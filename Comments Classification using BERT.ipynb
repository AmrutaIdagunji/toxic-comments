While the Japanese had been stopped at Coral Sea, they still had the initiative; they could still choose where and when to attack, and the allies had to react. But not after Midway! It was, after all, THEY that launched the Midway/Aleutians operation, and THEY that were then rocked back on their heels, and THEY that fled afterward. It was THEY that had lost 2/3 of their big, fast carriers (and the carrier was to the War in the Pacific what the ballistic missile was to the Cold War. Somewhere above someone argues that the remainder of the Japanese fleet was still a formidable force, but that is nonsense; all that force could do would be to sail out and get sunk by a carrier-equipped US NAvy)). Far from being \"\"merely\"\" a tactical victory, it changed the whole complexion of the war. \\n\\nNow, while they DID attempt some more offensive action (notably by trying to take Port Moresby, again, this time over land via the Kokoda Trail in the 2nd half of 1942), this was all relatively minor, designed to strengthen their DEFENSIVE positions not to conquer, and was  ultimately almost all unsuccessful. They never again tried the kind of massive, seaborne, combined arms operation that had swept them across most of the Pacific in a just a few months. Then just 2 months after Midway the US landed on Guadalcanal, and clearly the initiative was ours, and Japan was in defensive mode. Thus the Guadalcanal campaign can\\'t be considered the actual turning point either - by then the US was clearly on the attack.\\n\\nI don\\'t think the argument that there is no turning point because Japan could never have ultimately \\'won\\' the Pacific war works out either. Japanese planners DID know that they could not win a long war MILITARILY but that was not their plan. Strategically their plans went something like: \\n\\n1. Start the war from as superior a position as possible (hence Pearl Harbor)\\n2. Race across the Pacific, seizing resources and territory BEFORE the US could gear up for war.\\n3. Attain as defensible a position as possible (Hence the Kokoda Trail offensive and takeover of the Solomons) and DIG IN.\\n4. Let the US grind itself down against near impregnable fortresses. \\n5.Win a favorable peace settlement when the US tires itself out throwing itself against their defenses.\\n\\nBut they failed at (1) when they didn\\'t sink the US carriers at Pearl Harbor, and only 6 months later Midway signalled the early end of (2). By the failure to take Port Moresby, they also failed at part of (3). They had some hope to succeed at (5); when the bloody costs of both Tarawa and Buna-Gona became known, US public opinion was shaken. Even as late as 1945, many americans found the though of the casualties invading Japan would cost to be appalling.\\n\\nSo, MY conclusion is that Midway WAS *the* turning point in the Pacific. I realize this whole idea of a turning point is rather subjective, but I really think if there was one in the South Pacific, it has to be Midway.\\n \\nFerrocephalus (talk) \"', 'I believe my Article was notable enough this time \\n\\nHello.

Harris:\\nVernon R. Harris attended the University of Oklahoma studying electrical engineering. He has worked for the Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force, and the Federal Aviation Administration performing various technical functions. Some of his technical writing work for the U.S. Air Force has been used around the world in the maintenance of fighter aircraft. He also produced technical writing and general instructional manuals for other agencies. Vernon has written, but not yet published, several books in the area of humor, science fiction, general fiction, and science. He has also created structural documentation systems for several organizations. Vernon specializes in writing books that cross normal book categories and combines more than one type of information into stories from fiction, science fiction, philosophical and non-fiction areas. Some of his stories are classified as fiction but are largely based on real life experiences. He is now mostly retired and owns a small company, Bear Mountain Scientific, that he uses to fulfill various types of writing contracts. His company web site is BearMountainScientific.com.\\nPublications: Vernon R. Harris has published three books as of August, 2009. They are:\\nThe Travelers - The Travelers, is a fiction story about a couple, Ray and Sue Barker, visiting a new town during a vacation where they met a very unusual couple one day. The couple they met is referred to as “The Travelers,” and their names were Carl and Collie. Ray and Sue visited with The Travelers for a while and even had lunch with them. What they learned about The Travelers and their backgrounds left Ray and Sue almost speechless. This is the story about the Travelers and their strange tales. It is a story of visitors or travelers from another planet but with a totally different twist. Those readers of the Christian faith will find this story especially interesting. Those readers who are science buffs or scientists will find this story very intriguing. Is the story of The Travelers possibly real, and not just fiction? Listen to the facts as they unfold, and you decide. ISBN:  978-1-61582-414-4\\n\\nThe Cats of Coward County - The Cats of Coward County is a fictional story about a scientific experiment that accidentally resulted in a group of cats developing some human like characteristics. Since they were cats first, their cat personality was dominate but they were able to develop new skills, and memories, and, they could talk. These are some of the humorous stories involved with this group of cats that try so hard to organize and develop their own little town, a town called \"\"Cat City.” The personality and humorous antics of each cat living in Cat City comes to life as the stories unfold. Mouser, a real cat, is fictionalized as the Father of Cat City and is recognized as the Mayor of the town and attempts to guide the other cats in the development of their town and solving it\\'s many problems. The many stories are filled with humor showing how the cats dealt with their new found thoughts that are filled with both human and cat memories. You will be introduced to Cat City, how it got started, what it looks like, and how the cats make it work for them. You will get to know Vern and Pam who helped the cats get their town started and how they helped the cats organize all the different parts of their town. Vern and Pam, who lived close by, got involved only when it was absolutely necessary. We hope you enjoy meeting all the cats. The Cats of Coward County is designed to add a new perspective to your imagination and a sense of humor and how cats might evolve in these circumstances.

They traveled together in a wagon train. Dozens of wagon trains had already made it across the country and had pretty well marked the way, if there is such a thing, for those that followed. They traveled by wagon train because the promised railroad going from east to west was far behind schedule and seemed like a distant, hope. It describes one type of hardship and danger the early pioneers had to endure. This is the story of one part of one journey and the impact it had on the entire wagon train.

Regarding your question about courtly material, I don't really understand your point - obviously a Welsh author familiar with French culture could have incorporated elements from it into a native tale - but that doesn't seem to be the case here, as there is no evidence for a pre-Norman Peredur tale.

That in and of itself isn't that special. Lots of people started their own religions and churches. But he is different. He isn't just any religionist because he claims that he actually speaks with God face-to-face like prophets anciently. He claims that he received Golden Plates and he translated them by the power of God into the Book of Mormon. He claims to hold the keys to salvation. He claims that his is the only church that acts with real authority from God, and that all the other churches are imposters. Aren't you interested in what arguments have been made about whether or not he is a real prophet? If Joseph Smith merely claimed to be able to predict a few things, that would be one thing.

As a matter of fact, I have a referenced population for 1820 (54), shortly before foundation of the town. And I have one good enough estimate for 1834 (1,000). In 1861 they had 5,000 soldiers there, but that does not really count as population, does it? Today it might be in the few hundreds, not much more. It looks like any population more recent than 1834 would be of great help here already.\\n\\nI tried to find out about the voting precincts, but Randolph is included in the same voting precinct (14 S.W.

That means that Omega in this case is not final letter, because after Omega is placed too Sampi. Due to this fact, in this case God is not only local Ionian Alpha and Omega, because He is in this case too Somebody more - global Pan-Greek Alpha and Sampi. This fact should be acknowledged by all Christians that uses global Greek Alphabet, because in this case they can diminish God by excluding Him from full range of global Greek Alphabet. Ionians were justified by their unknowledge, and Jesus only adjusted Himself to their lower level of knowledge, calling Himself as local Ionian Beginning and End. Sho was placed between San and Qoppa and was only existing Greek letter not used by Greeks, but by Bactrians that adopted Greek alphabet. Comparison page is here.  \\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but \"\"Sampi\"\" was a kludge whereby a corrupt form of an archaic letter (formerly between Pi and Qoppa) was dragged in so that there would be 27 distinct symbols for the purposes of Isopsephy, while Sho was used in Central Asia to transcribe non-Greek languages. Neither of these symbols was ever used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language (which is the only thing which is relevant for the Bible).  \\n\\nThus that would mean that Sampi was corrupted version of San, that is placed between Pi and Qoppa.  \\n\\nProbably it was (though there is still some debate over the matter). But regardless of its origin, it still was never used as a letter to write the Greek Koine language (which is the only thing that\\'s relevant for this article).  \\n\\nBecause T-shaped alphabetic Sampi was introduced recently to Wikipedia, I think that it is in T-shape not corrupted, but fully fledged letter. For proof look into Sampi article to compare alphabetic T-Sampi and numeric C-Sampi. As you see, T-Sampi is more like russian П and too Greek PI, with addition of |, while C-Sampi is more like russian Э and too Greek LUNATE EPSILON, with addition of -. In this way T-Sampi should be primary, and C-Sampi secondary.

Bonnie might have spread some light rain a day or two earlier, I don't specifically remember, but Charley passed off our coast as a 40 mile per hour tropical storm. I remember this clearly because the most intense wind and rain were far ahead of Charley's center, and when the center was closest, there was no rain or wind to speak of onshore, mostly offshore. Earlier that day, Charley had been a Category One hurricane off of South Carolina, and a day or two before that, a monster Category 4, hitting Punta Gorda, Florida. Later that season, New Jersey got rains from the remnants of Frances, Gaston, Ivan & Jeanne. Jeanne was the strongest, and brought the most intense winds of that season, although Charley was far wetter.

I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don\\'t need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:\\n\\nIt is important to understand right from the start that there is no \\'default\\', \\'natural\\' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the \\'orbit\\', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object \\'in orbit\\'.\\n\\n That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn\\'t revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.\\n\\n Let me explain what I mean with my \"\"intuitiveness\"\" concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that\\'s not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that\\'s what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply \"\"antigravity\"\" to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he\\'s \"\"beating\"\" some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it\\'s real, he\\'s ready to accept that, although he\\'s applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to \"\"beat\"\" as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader. The same applies at an intuitive level with centripetal/centrifugal forces IMHO: if you start the article with an introductory statement which says that the centrifugal force doesn\\'t really exist, that confuses the reader (\"\"then what\\'s the force that I\\'m beating by holding on to the rope? Maybe I didn\\'t get it right...\"\") and s/he\\'s most probably going to miss the point of the whole thing long before you get to formulas.  \"', 'Nice one bro. Real nice.

In 1924, Lenin\\'s sister Anna discovered that their maternal grandfather, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Blank, had been born Srul (Israel), the son of Moshko Itskovich Blank, in the shtetl Starokonstantinov [Old Konstantinov] in Volynia [Volhynia, now Ukraine].

The question is, what are we going to do?\"\" What \"\"they,\"\" or rather, the Party through the Lenin Institute, did was proclaim this fact \"\"inappropriate for publication\"\" and decree that it be \"\"kept secret.\"\" In 1932 and again in 1934, Anna Ilinichna [Lenin\\'s sister] begged Stalin to reconsider, claiming that her discovery was, on the one hand, an important scientific confirmation of the \"\"exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe\"\" and \"\"the extraordinarily beneficial influence of its blood on the offspring of mixed marriages\"\"; and, on the other, a potent weapon against anti-Semitism \"\"owing to the prestige and love that [Vladimir] Ilich [Lenin] enjoys among the masses.\"\" Lenin\\'s own Jewishness, she argued, was the best proof of the accuracy of his view that the Jewish nation possessed a peculiar \"\"\\'tenacity\\' in struggle\"\" and a highly revolutionary disposition. \"\"Generally speaking,\"\" she concluded, \"\"I do not understand what reasons we, as Communists, may have for concealing this fact. Logically, this does not follow from the recognition of the full equality of all nationalities.\"\" Stalin\\'s response was an order to \"\"keep absolutely quiet.\"\" Anna Ilinichna did.

When his sister, Anna, found out, she wrote to Stalin that she was not surprised, and \"\"this fact\"\" was \"\"another proof of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe,\"\" and that Lenin had always contrasted \"\"what he called its \\'tenacity\\' in struggle with the more sluggish and lackadaisical Russian character.\"\" (p. 163)\\n\\n \"\"And in 1965, all archival documents relating to Lenin\\'s Jewish grandfather were ordered \"\"removed without leaving any copies.\"\" (pg. 338)\\n\\n  \"', 'Diego Sanchez\\nPlease stop adding the unnoficial fight of the night bonus for the Diego Sanchez x Karo Parisyan bout.

Nice job, kiddo. \\n\\nYou said, one some poor guy\\'s talk page:\\n\\nI hope you will use this block time to consider a few matters that could make you a better editor, should you decide to continue. First, Wikipedia editors aren\\'t nearly as stupid as you think they are. We include many people with advanced degrees who work in scholarly professions. Many of us can see through the kind of lies that you tried to use better than we can see through glass. Secondly, disruptive editing, lying, and attempts to sabotage the system not only get you into trouble, they also defeat the very goals that you are trying to achieve. If MattyBraps is deleted, one of the major reasons (but certainly not the only reason) is your behavior as creator of the article. You did serious damage to your own efforts to keep the article on Wikipedia. And finally, take some time to read Wikipedia policies. Start with WP:5P, and every time you see a blue link, click it and read what you see. If you can do these things, you might stand a chance of becoming a good editor. Otherwise, you need to move on to somewhere else to spend your time. Think about it.   \\n\\nI would contend that Wikipedia editors are, in fact, as stupid as I suspect, as you still fail to grasp that the BT guy and I (the IP user you believe he sockpuppeted) are not the same person. All it took was me mirroring the way he types, pretending to be angry, and claiming \"\"I made the [Mattybraps] page,\"\" and boom, I got him blocked. Thanks for helping me settle a bet about whether or not I could get the creator of the Mattyb wikipedia page (it\\'s an embarrassment that it exists) banned inside of a week.

Start with something simpler, since there are certainly simpler aspects of diffraction than multislit-with-vectors. File:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png would certainly be an improvement (simpler case, still a pretty picture that clearly illustrates some key ideas). I think that diagram would be even better if the barrier/slit were actually visible clearly rather than just another thin black line in a parallel field of black lines: consider either File:Difraction.png or File:Difrakce sterbina bodova.png.

I also think it\\'s very important to keep to the issue of diacritical marks in the original orthography of the language, and not stray into either additional letters (like eth or thorn) or the use of diacritical marks in transcription/transliteration (like retaining accents when going from πότε to póte or marking long vowels by macrons in transliterating a number of languages, including Greek and Japanese). These are separate issues.\\n\\nThe problems, for me, are primarily in the first paragraph of WP:DIACRITICS, which is evasive, muddled and inconsistent:\\n – this is just evasion. Their use or non-use should be motivated, and hence should be encouraged or discouraged according to the strength of the motivation.\\n – this encouragement to count \"\"hits\"\" just results in muddled policy, apart from the problem of the weasel word \"\"general\"\". However, this bit seems clear that the \"\"modifications\"\" are to the same word, i.e. can be treated as stylistic modifications.\\n This seems to me not to be consistent with the sentence before: is \"\"the common name\"\" here supposed to be with or without the added diacritical marks? \"\"[V]ersions of  word\"\" above should mean that \"\"the common \"\" is the same with or without the diacritical marks.\\nIs it possible to re-write this paragraph to achieve consensus? I don\\'t know.   \\n\\n Agreed those are separate issuesAgreed the first quoted passage is evasive, but motivating use or avoidance of diacritics seems to be the sticking point.  Did you have some particular direction in mind?  My take has been that if reliable sources show that their use is normal for the names in question that they should be used here, except where particular subjects eschew them. E.g. for a baseball player named Eddie Sandoval we\\'d give him as Eddie Sándoval if some reliable sources did (it can\\'t be based on a majority of English language sources, since majority of them ignore diacritics entirely, as a matter of editorial/publishing convenience). It\\'s the same principle that we can cite a single source for Eddie\\'s birth date and place even if most sources don\\'t mention them.  A fact does not have to be provided by every single source to be considered reliable.  And it\\'s not a matter of sources conflicting (analogous to giving two different birth dates); some giving only Sandoval without the diacritics is like some sources giving a birth year but not a full birth date; it is incomplete information, not conflicting information.  On the other hand, if Eddie himself is quoted saying he doesn\\'t use the diacritic that should be a trumping factor (unless WP totally ditches subject preference in all areas, which seems unlikely given the number of discussions going on to make more allowances for subject preference all over the place).  This can apply to geography, too (Santa Fe, New Mexico is \"\"Santa Fe\"\" not \"\"Santa Fé\"\" despite the popularity of the diacritic in certain circles; the official name of both the city and the county are \"\"Santa Fe\"\" with no accent. People frequently cite WP:OFFICIALNAME as if it were a policy, but it\\'s actually just an essay, it may not accurately reflect the nuances in cases like this, and people often cite it without actually understanding what it says to begin with (it\\'s frequently misinterpreted as being against use of official names, when it\\'s really only against using them when they\\'re directly unhelpful to readers, while otherwise we would almost certainly use the official name)I\\'m not sure \"\"general\"\" in the second passage is actually a weasel word, rather than just lack of clarity.  It\\'s not clear if it means the predominant use in reliable sources generally, the predominant use in general-audience sources, or both.  The inclusion of \"\"and reference works\"\" strongly suggests the former.

Partisans came after Red Army (or together with it at least). Also, it is the main difference between Germans and Jews, since most of the Jews were killed or deported during the war, while most of the Germans escaped before they could became a subject for persecutions. Second thing, during the war, Serbs also were persecuted and thousands of them were held in prison camps or expelled. The only difference between Germans and Serbs here is that Serbs returned to their homes after the war, and Germans did not. So, is that difference a good reason to write here only about persecuted Germans and not about persecuted Serbs too? It is good that you said that the one who want to know who were partisans should to read the \"\"Partisans\"\" article, because the one who want to know more why Germans fled should to read Danube Swabians article.

I found no similarity between the Vassar Web site and the article.

If you weren\\'t so eager to smash things rather than fix them, you would have noticed that. And you couldn\\'t even be bothered to let me know there might be a problem. I hope our paths never cross again but I suppose I\\'ll have to watch your contributions in future to make sure you aren\\'t deleting everything I do. What a waste of time. Oh yeah - I\\'ll assume you were smashing in good faith. As if. Thanks for ruining my (formerly) good mood, as I was enjoying making some useful contributions to Wikipedia articles.   \\nWelcome to Wikipedia. Now, a recap. With this edit you added a link to the current MPs list, for Carter. Problem was it was for David Carter, not John Carter so I removed it. I went to replace it with one for John Carter, but there is none, so I couldn\\'t. You then added another link, but like the first one it too went to the wrong person, this time, Cam Calder. I removed it with the edit summary \"\"Cannot replace it because Carter is no longer an mp\"\". You have responded by inserting a brand new link to Former MPs. I was unaware Carter has been added to that list, but that is beside the point because I was removing links to current MPs. If you intend to edit Wikipedia for a while I suggest you don\\'t shout in your edit summaries as you did with \"\"Former MPs DO HAVE WORKING LINKS. Wikipedians fix links rather than delete them\"\",  and you address the actual issue and don\\'t jump to conclusions.   \\nNot true! The actual issue was that you deleted ALL the links I added for him. That is the recap. The two other links worked fine, but you deleted them as well in your hurry to smash everything someone else did. In other words, you are the one who jumped to conclusions. Now you\\'re trying to claim you only deleted the one that was a problem. Even your edit summary is wrong. The man\\'s resignation was presented the same day I was adding the links, unknown to me, so it seems the Parliament link was being moved from current to former which caused pointer problems when I clicked on it. Things happen. It only needed to be fixed. I would have thought an Admin would be capable of figuring that out. Nor could you figure out how to leave a message on my Talk page so I could figure it out. You just couldn\\'t wait to smash everything. I only came back to the article because I was going through the non-Cabinet people on the list. Did you fix that list, once you realized this was a former MP? No, you did not. That would have been \"\"work\"\", requiring \"\"thought\"\" and \"\"effort\"\". Same as you mis-corrected the hat note on the other John Carter MP. Based on your arrogance, I thought it likely you were an Admin. What a surprise, I was right. And Jimbo wonders why the numbers of actual contributors are going straight downhill. I have NO intention of continuing to contribute to Wikipedia because you obviously would prefer to do everything yourself. You\\'re not at all welcoming, helpful, polite, assuming good faith, or anything else I was led to believe is part of the Wikipedia ethos. So I leave you to it. You didn\\'t even have the grace to apologize for deleting the other links, you just tried to blame me in this audit trail. Go lecture someone else, because I\\'m out of here, and you can be sure I won\\'t be encouraging anyone else to participate in what could have been a good project. Your attitude is horrendous, and I\\'m sure I\\'m not the first one you\\'ve chased out of here. Well, keep it up and you\\'ll soon have the whole thing to yourself. Enjoy.

All sorts of bullshit claims have been made about Saddam, I notice few people have even tried to prove them.  How can I present evidence of a fake if they are all fake?

That the nominator did not conduct the most simple research before nominating these templates for deletion is shown here: the fact that the TfD notice was not included within  tags led to the disruption of over 5000 articles, something which the nominator could have prevented had he thought to used simple discussion before even contemplating bringing the matter here. The disruption was completely predictable, given that the nominator chose to nominate more than 200 templates at once.

Secondly, it is not at all clear why TFD is not the place to discuss a vast collection of templates whose only purpose is a gimmick that breaks web accessibility.

The council has so far made little progress in unifying armed forces.

Though loyal to the NTC, they have also feuded among themselves and acted on their own initiative, and the council has been unable to control them.\\n\\nHundreds of well-equipped and highly trained remnants of Gadhafi\\'s forces battled for eight hours in Bani Walid with the local revolutionary brigade, known as the May 28 Brigade, which was eventually driven out, said Mubarak al-Fatmani, the head of Bani Walid local council. The Gadhafi loyalists then raised the green flag over buildings in the western city.\\n\\nOn Monday\\'s attack, he said four revolutionary fighters were killed and 25 others were wounded.\\n\\nThe revolutionary brigade had kept only a superficial control over the mountain city, a longtime Gadhafi stronghold which was one of the last to fall to NTC rule late last year.\"\"The only link between Bani Walid and the revolution was May 28, now it is gone and 99 percent of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists,\"\" said the head of Bani Walid\\'s military council, Abdullah al-Khazmi, confirming the fall of the city. He spoke to The Associated Press at a position on the eastern outskirts of Bani Walid, where hundreds of pro-NTC reinforcements from Benghazi were deployed, with convoys of cars mounted with machine guns.\\n\\nA top commander of a revolutionary brigade in Bani Walid, Ali al-Fatmani, who was present in Benghazi during the attack, says he has lost contact with other fighters in the town.The three officials said the attackers belong to Brigade 93, a militia newly created by Gadhafi loyalists who reassembled after the fall of the regime. The fighters, flush with cash and heavy weaponry including incendiary bombs, have been increasing in power in the city, they said.\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'A month ago, Gadhafi loyalists attacked another revolutionary brigade from Tripoli that entered Bani Walid, killing 13, said al-Fatmani.\"\"\\n\\nNow dou you see the bold part?\\n\\n  \"', \"(to Iridescent, waaaay back above) You are probably the best person to actually propose such reforms.

The entry includes, \"\"The Troubles began in Northern Ireland in 1969, and Bell\\'s The Secret Army: the IRA 1916-1970 was published the following year, and was one of the first detailed histories of the IRA along with The IRA by Tim Pat Coogan which was also published in 1970.[3]\"\"  So, ONIH refers to Bell as the author of a detailed history of the IRA.

But it does imply that the information has survived a responsible vetting process by fact checkers and lawyers.\\n\\n(By the way, according to the flap copy of the book,\"\"Feeling Your Pain,\"\" (at least as published in hardcover by St. Martin\\'s Press, 2000), the writing of the author, Bovard, \"\"has been denounced by FBI Director Louis Freeh, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the White House AIDS czar, as well as by the Chiefs of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the U.S. International Trade Commission.\"\")\\n\\nAs is now clear, \"\"Feeling Your Pain\"\" does not even mention NCCC or the National Civilian Community Corps (except in the footnotes, referring to one speech by then-President Clinton  not exactly a source of documented criticism of a program he signed into law), in a chapter devoted to what was then 50,000 members of AmeriCorps, not the 1100+ Corps Members of NCCC.\\n\\nSo to Dbiel and Che Nuevara: It took a lot to get me to sound off about LoverOfArt. I responded calmly to his repeated rants about me, saying I was foaming at the mouth, my writing was Lunacy, fluff, and similar crap.  At this point his \"\"editing\"\" of the National Civilian Community Corps has been conclusively demonstrated as biased and maliciously distorted:  his doctoring of quotes into misleading criticisms of the National Civilian Community Corps (quoting NCCC as having been labeled a \"\"fraud\"\" in an article he cites that does not mention NCCC) should disqualify him from being part of this group.\\n\\nWhen I read what he wrote and posted at Wikipedia, quoting the author of Feeling Your Pain as calling NCCC a \"\"fraud\"\" in an article he cites (untrue), saying the author devoted an entire chapter of his book to criticism of NCCC (untrue)  in a book published by St. Martin\\'s Press, even I started to doubt the litany of glowing reports from credible and verifiable sources that I had read about this organization.\\n\\nSomeone unfamiliar with positive reports about NCCC would have been even more likely to greet news of the demise of NCCC - something ardently sought recently by persons using the same kinds of arguments LoverofArt posted  with detachment, if not pleasure.\\n\\nThat his statements  quotes  about NCCC are now known to be false and misleading means that he no longer enjoys an assumption of Good Faith.\\n\\nSo I would like you to spare me your lectures about my supposed sins. \"\"No information is better than misleading information,\"\" as Jimbo Wales liked to say. LoverOfArt has no business mauling the content of this page, nor does Wikipedia have any business disseminating his posts.\\n\\nI am perfectly ready and willing to work respectfully and cooperatively with any editor who has not used the vicious and underhanded methods that LoverofArt has resorted to.\\n\\nI have shown a willingness to respond to your editorial concerns. Dbiel wanted more notable sources. I posted a number of them quickly, including citations from the Baltimore Sun, the NY TImes, The Washington Times, and an Arizona newspaper - news outlets reflecting a spectrum of points of view.  (LoverofArt discounted all of the Baltimore Sun citations, saying none were notable.)\\n\\nI don\\'t maintain that my copy (or my view of what should be at the NCCC page) is perfect or unassailable or that other\\'s work has no place. I have labeled some posts \"\"suggested edits.\"\"  I have no problem with honest content that is in context that runs counter to my perspective.\\n\\nBut LoverofArt is clearly willing to resort to dishonest (or at the very least, grossly misleading) editing to ensure that his view prevails.  My editing reflects my perspective, but it  is not dishonest:  I present information that is verifiable and accurate, to the best of my ability.  If I make a mistake, and I sometimes do, I try to correct it, and I would welcome the correction of others - I do not want to be have a part in disseminating inaccurate or misleading information.  \\n\\nI left LoverofArt\\'s Criticisms page on the NCCC article for a long time, until I could verify whether or not it was accurate.

Formal argument is necessary because this argument has degenerated so far (by me, mostly, just for fun). I\\'ll break it down piece by piece so it\\'s easier to digest for people unwilling to read what others are saying:\\n\\nPurpose of this argument: To fix a very serious problem with structure, clarity, and reader friendliness inherent in this page and in the topic as a whole. The problem is that the term \"\"Beat Generation\"\" is used in multiple ways to the degree that it becomes confusing for the general reader and leads to arguments about who \"\"is\"\" and \"\"isn\\'t\"\" a \"\"beat.\"\"\\n\\nProposal: We should fix the structure of the page \\n\\nGinsberg Deliberate Prose:\\n\"\"The phrase \\'beat generation\\' rose out of a specific conversation with Jack Kerouac and John Clellon Holmes around \\'50-51 when, discussing the nature of generations recollecting the glamour of the lost generation, Kerouac said, Ah, this is nothing but a beat generation ... not meaning to name the generation but to un-name it.\"\"\\n\\nHe discusses the origin of the term \"\"beat\"\" in \"\"hip language\"\" froom Huncke and then discusses how it became associated with \"\"beatific\"\" in 1959 (and on a side note, that reinforces Doom\\'s side of a previous disagreement, though Ginsberg says \"\"articulated\"\" which could mean it was conceived of earlier).\\n\\n\"\"A fourth meaning accumulated, that of the \\'beat generation literary movement.\\' This was a group of friends who had worked together on peotry, prose and cultural conscience from the mid-forties until the term became popular natuionally in the late fifties. The group consisting of Kerouac ... Neal Cassady, William Burroughs ... Herbert Huncke, John Clellon Homes ... Allen Ginsberg, myself; we met Carl Solomon and Philip Lamantia in \\'48; encountered Gregory Corso in 1950, and we first saw Peter Orlovsky in 1954.\\n\\n\"\"By the mid-fifties this smaller circle, through natural affinity of modes of thought or literary style or planetary perspective was augmented in friendship and literary endeavor by a number of writers in San Francisco, including Michael McClure, Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen and a number of other powerful but lesser-known poets such as Jack Micheline, Ray Bremser, and ... LeRoi Jones  all of whom accepted the term at one time or another, humorously or seriously, but sympathetically, and were included in a survey of bet general manners, morals, and literature by Life magazine in a lead article in the late \\'50s by one Paul O\\'Neill, and by the journalist Alfred Aronowitz in a large series on the Beat Generation in the New York Post.\\n\\n\"\"By the mid-fifties a sense of some mutual trust and interest was developed with Frank O\\'Hara and Kenneth Koch, as well as with Robert Creeley and other alumni of Black Mountain ...\\n\\n\"\"The fifth meaning of the phrase \\'Beat Generation\\' is the influence of the literary and artistic activities of poets, filmmakers, painters, writers and novelists who were working in concert in anthologies, publishing houses, independent filmmaking, and other media. Some effects of the aforementioned groups refreshed the bohemian culture which was already a long tradition (in film and still photography, Robert Frank and Alfred Leslie; in music, david Amram; in painting, Larry Rivers; in poetry publishing, Don Allen, Barney Rosset, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti) extended to fellow artists such as Susan Sontag and Norman Mailer.\"\" etc.\"', '\" June 2010 (UTC)\\n\\nExcellent - look forward to the results.

That\\'s an accurate description of the view that things relating to Greece use words (in English) derived from Greek-language Hellas on the basis that Greeks themselves prefer this term. If this were a discussion about Germans wanting everything about Germany to use Deutsche in English too, that would be a German-centric concern (i.a. a concern centered on Germany, Germans, and their preferences).  NB: I actually know Germans who insist that we should stop saying \"\"German\"\" and \"\"Germany\"\" (and that the Spanish should stop using Alemán), and everyone use \"\"Deutsche\"\" and \"\"Deutschland\"\", so, no, it is not a red herring fallacy at all, but a comparison chosen carefully (though not carefully enough; see a bit later). Your own counter however, is a straw man fallacy; no one said anything about transliterating vs. not transliterating, so the \"\"Ελλάς\"\" argument is a complete non sequitur.

However, during the time period that Mary Ambrose was involved with Robert Palmer, she was involved with a number of men, even having two children, in 2001 and 2002, with men known to Robert Palmer. Mary Ambrose's son born in 2001 was fathered by Mick Carter, who was Robert Palmer's manager, until Palmer fired him in the second week of September. Unfortunately, since Mick Carter was the first person to discover that Robert Palmer had died, he took the opportunity to lie to the press on a number of points, including naming Mary Ambrose as Robert Palmer's girlfriend. Robert Palmer was no longer involved with Mary Ambrose before his death. His only contact with her at that point was trying to iron out a settlement agreement with Ambrose ensuring that she would not give interviews about him, or discuss him with the press. Mick Carter was not fond of Robert's true girlfriend, in fact he disliked her intently. Robert Palmer hadn't told many people about Mick Carter's firing, opting to complete his publicity appearances in Paris for Drive before doing so. Carter was fully aware of this, and took advantage of the situation. When it was discovered what he had done, and the surfeit of bogus and incorrect information that he had provided to the press worldwide, the information was invalidated due to his firing and credibility issues. Because of his close friendship with Mary Ambrose, he saw a money making opportunity for them in Robert Palmer's death. Carter even went so far as to stage a 'hoax' interview on Mary Ambrose's behalf, entitled Robert Palmer Was Addicted To My Love. The article appeared on the 28th of September, two days after the death of Palmer. The interview allegedly took place by phone, backed up by a signed release. When the interview was challenged by the family as being false, the interview was basically Robert Palmer emoting about Mary Ambrose, who his children knew he was no longer involved with in any vernacular at the time of his death, the article was revealed to be a hoax. At the time Robert Palmer was allegedly giving this interview by phone, he was in fact in attendance at a social function accompanied by three friends of his, who vouched he was with them the entire time the interview was allegedly taking place. As for the release, it was proven that Robert Palmer's signature was forged, and not a very good forgery at that. The article was to appear in three parts, but once the publishers realized that the article was a hoax, they cancelled the publication of the other two parts of the article and invalidated the one part that they had ran.\", 'By the way, I am NOT the author of the Tebson article, I just came across it after it was tagged as a speedy deletion request.', \"As for Elvis's identification with the Jews, I have provided several reliable sources.\", 'I am under attack! \\n\\nYou guys are censoring any opinion that you do not agree with!

The one Antoinette quote that is offered to this end, smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her OWN cause, by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her. There\\'s nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the French people, but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her. Calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason, so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids. So, this statement, that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her, certainly does NOT certify Marie Antoinette as kind hearted or noble. I suspect, that much as the phrase is thrown around today, it was probably thrown around by the clique of it\\'s originator. They probably had a real laugh, suggesting things the peasants could eat, when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy. Here\\'s how I imagine the phrase came to be said by Marie Antoinette is she heard her royal family, her mom and dad and step parents, maybe her grandparents, talking about what had been said in an age past, when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause. Then, when she found herself in the situation, she used what was in her circle a cliche, that was widely unknown to the rest of the world. She probably didn\\'t think much of saying it, she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around, never become more widely known that she said it AND probably she hadn\\'t really considered how callous it is when people are starving, to make light of it. So, my guess, is that, EXACTLY as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured, peasants starving, Marie-Thérèse originated it, the phrase circulated amongst Royalty for 100 years, probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was Marie-Thérèse, how callous and witty and devilishly fun (from the sadistic royal perspective). So Marie-Thérèse originates it, Marie Antoinette\\'s family speaks of it, tells the story. Marie Antoinette happens upon the same situation, bread shortage, she rehashes the phrase originated by Marie-Thérèse. Rouseau writing of it, attributing it to a Princess who he had not heard first hand say it, proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles. He says some earlier royal said it, presumably she said it to other royals and presumably Rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals. So, obviously, if Marie-Thérèse said it, 100 years before Rouseau wrote it, obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller, who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hi-jinks those callous witty royals do, for love of reliving the old times and as \"\"lessons\"\" to the young royals on how to live. Marie Antoinette saying it, in royal company, would be like her saying, I\\'m on your side royal friends. It\\'s basically a slightly witty way for Marie Antoinette to say she doesn\\'t care how the peasants get through their hard times, how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times, callous, is her intent and plan. It was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation. Many here have claimed that because Rouseau wrote it before Antoinette could possibly have said it, means that Antoinette never said it. That\\'s OBVIOUSLY nonsense. She OBVIOUSLY didn\\'t originate the phrase, credit Marie-Thérèse, but that wouldn\\'t prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit.\"', 'And in your case, stop vandalising.', '\"\\nThe introduction is supposed to summarise that part of the article which follows the table of contents, see MOS:LEAD.

Anyway, I\\'ve read all the English items, in some cases more than once.I can see that the Gounder community phrase is used in the sense of meaning the KV community, but that is only apparent if there is a \"\"hook\"\" in the article to give it some context. Eg: an article talks abour the KMK, you know that KMK = KV, and so when it then says \"\"Gounder community\"\" then the context makes it is obvious that they mean KV. I\\'ve not explained that particularly well, but short version: yes, in the examples Gounder community = KV.\\n\\nThe problem is, that is not good enough. You cannot prove that the term is not used to refer to other groups of Gounder than the KV, nor could I find a really clear-cut example among the English language sources: all of them demanded that the reader already knew some background - eg: that KMK = KV party. Sure, you know that but someone born & bred in the UK or USA, Germany or Guatemala, Australia and Austria most probably will not. In that sense, you are engaging in synthesis, and we are not allowed to do that here.\\n\\nYou said that the Tamil sources were important. Are they really going to resolve the issues that I raise? In particular, is even one of them going to explicitly say that the term is used either \"\"always\"\" or \"\"most frequently\"\" to refer to KVs? -   \\n\\n, none of them will say, Gounder \"\"always\"\" refers to KVs because there are other communities too that are using the title. But you need to view from another angle. Why other communities (non-Kvs) are not referred as just Gounder Community ? Because, all the sections of Vettuvars, Vanniyars, Vokkaligas don\\'t use Gounder title. Only some sections of those communities use the title and hence they cannot be generally referred as Gounder community. This gives the freedom to refer KVs as Gounder community. \\n\\n\"\"All of them demanded that the reader already knew some background - eg: that KMK = KV party\"\". This is not very difficult. We can attach this reference along with other references to prove that KMK or KMP = KV party. Anyway, if this not enough, here is another reference which says about Gounder community (taken from Deccan Chronicle). Persons belonging to Kongu Vellalar are mentioned as persons from Gounder Community.To prove that, Gounder community mentioned here refers to Kongu Vellalar, I have attached the proof here. which says Sengottaiyan is a Kongu Vellalar. No need to infer from KMP or KMK. This reference will directly establish that Gounder Community mentioned refers to Kongu Vellalar.

JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE SITE BETTER YOU UPTIGHT CUNTS', '\"\\n\\nArticle needs review by nuclear physicist(s)\\nJust skimming the introduction I found three rather significant factual errors which I corrected.  I review those here.\\n\\nThe first point was that the article insisted that fusion occurs between like-charged atomic nuclei, but this limitation is not true.  For example, a nuclear reaction of 12C+16O can proceed through the fusion channel, yet their atomic charge differs.  There are literally hundreds of such cases, and citation would be gregarious and seems unnecessary (but I can link a few articles if anyone disputes this point).\\n\\nThe article suggested that two protons can fuse, and even suggested that such a reaction is governed by the nuclear strong force.  Not true.  p+p->d is a weak interaction, because you must convert a proton into a neutron.  Weak interactions are not fusion.\\n\\nThis error leads to a more general point.  Simply putting nuclei together to make something heavier does not constitute fusion.  A common misconception is that nuclear fusion refers to any coalescence of nuclei, but in nuclear physics, fusion is a specific reaction mechanism.  I will need to confirm, but I believe that, for example, the reactions in the CNO cycles proceed mainly through radiative capture, which isn\\'t fusion.  I can find comments in the introduction instructing me not to correct the \"\"general\"\" statement about nucleosynthesis, but the point is that this is generalized so much that it is incorrect.  I can even find comments there saying not to link to the s-process, but the s-process does not involve fusion reactions as far as I know.  There are actually a rather limited number of stellar nucleosynthesis cases that actually proceed through the fusion mechanism, such as carbon burning and oxygen burning.  These are literally the only two examples I can think of off hand that I\\'m sure proceed via fusion.  All the rest I\\'m fairly dubious about at the moment, although some of the pp-chain reactions may also be fusion.\\n\\nThus, we in fact need likely a whole section explaining the nuclear physics of fusion and what it is and what it is not.\\n\\nFinally, I noticed that the article suggested humans have never controlled fusion.  This is naff.  There are plenty of nuclear physics experiments which have not only controlled fusion, but made very careful measurements of the properties of the fusion mechanism at many energy scales.  Clearly, the writer wanted to imply that fusion as a source of stable source of energy has never been achieved by humans, so this was changed to reflect that point.\\n\\nBut given that I could find a serious physics error in every paragraph I read so far, clearly this article needs some serious attention Please do not revert my corrections without discussing the matter here or explicit citation indicating that I am incorrect.    \"', '26, 23 August 2008 (UTC)\\n\\nYes you can.

Also, as per your \"\"I (Joy) didn\\'t overlook anything - none of these links were referenced in the article or in the talk page\"\" claim, it is not true. The first three links I presented to you just above have been on this talk page page for 8 years (and the AFP story from the FIFA official page is among them) and you clearly were aware of them back in 2006 as the ANON referenced them when addressing you directly and you even mention some explicitly yourself in your responses.

The reason there is a difference in the Guinness record and lifts sanctioned by less notable organizations is that there are different rules on what technique constitutes a lift, if equipment is allowed to aid the lifter, and if performance enhancing drugs are tested for. If you take away all rules and judging, then anyone can claim the record. Aaron's home run record does not include the home runs he hit in the negro leagues. Josh Gibson is not the HR record holder. You can't just go out to your local gym, alert the media and complete the lift. It has to be judged by an existing set of regulations. What is a lift? Is there a pause on the chest? Can the athlete use legs to push? Can they be on drugs? Who tests? How often? Who weighs the official plates that were used? Does it have to be a standard bench? Are you allowed to put bungee cords under your lifting shirt? When is the lift complete? Lucky for us there is already an organization, recognized by the world, that takes care of all there rules and regulations. The argument is simple.

Sure, Trask has, mainly because his reconstruction of Pre-Basque is different. (I will mention this more prominently in the article.) But besides?\\n\\nHere is a post by Stefan Georg on when a hypothesis on language relationships should be considered accepted. For the record, Georg is currently most famous for fighting against the Altaic hypothesis (though he accepts a Tungusic-Korean-Japonic grouping as likely), rejects Nostratic, rejects DC, but accepts Seefloth\\'s Uralo-Siberian because it\\'s based on morphology. Here is a follow-up by Trask, here one by Vovin, and here another one by Georg.\\n\\nTo be an Indo-Europeanist, you have to know a lot about each of the branches of IE. How many people, other than the late Starostin, have anything near that kind of knowledge about East Caucasian and West Caucasian and Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan and so on? Bengtson seems to be working on it, but he almost completely limits himself to Basque, the two Caucasians, and Burushaski (which he finds to be closely related), but he almost never mentions Sino-Tibetan or Na-Dené. That makes about one half of a person that is capable of judging the DC hypothesis (as a whole) beyond finding mistakes in the data from one of the supposed members. For that matter, Starostin himself largely ignored Na-Dené, Basque, and Burushaski.\\n\\nIs there (already) a paper that takes the proposed evidence apart? If so, I\\'ll be glad to cite it. (For the record, here is a discussion of a paper that shows, IMHO quite clearly, that what little evidence there was for including Omotic in Afro-Asiatic was wrong. A link to that paper is included.)\\n\\nHere, incidentally, is an introduction to Burushaski – secondary literature – which makes favorable comparisons to Yeniseian and Sino-Tibetan.\\n\\nIn sum, I don\\'t see anything wrong with presenting the hypothesis (in its latest incarnation) on Wikipedia. It is a controversial discussion subject, so (comparatively) many people will find it interesting.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I\\'ll add some morphological evidence (suppletive pronoun paradigms, noun class prefixes) to the Macro-Caucasian section of the article, provided that Bengtson tells me that this paper is actually published.

This verse is interpreted by some Muslims as giving women a degree of autonomy over their own income and property but obliging them to comply with the husband\\'s wishes should they be congruent with Islamic principles and beneficial to the marriage. The verse is also interpreted to mean that men are also obliged to be responsible for maintenance of their female relatives.[1]\\n\\nThere are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. [2]Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.[3] However, some have translated \"\"beat\"\" as \"\"separate\"\", as Arabic in its nature is a multi-meaning language, and as such no word has a fixed sole meaning.[4]\\n\\nIbn Abbas, a companion of Muhammad, wrote the earliest commentary on the Quran, and to this part he himself said this is only a light tap.[5] When asked about the light hitting, he said it refers to using a siwak (toothbrush).

I\\'m proposing Ling.Nut-Lite. I just don\\'t think removing that whole paragraph is the best solution. I want to condense it to just the main points, leaving certain details for further discussion in the body. Here\\'s what I propose so far:\\n\\nThe Six Day War or June War..., also known as the 1967 Arab-Israeli war or the Third Arab-Israeli War, was fought between 5 June and 10 June, 1967 by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt [then the United Arab Republic, UAR], Jordan, and Syria. At the war\\'s end, Israel had seized the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.\\n\\nAfter the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egypt agreed to the stationing of a United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) in the Sinai to ensure compliance with the armistice agreement and prevent raids across the border . On 4 November 1966, Syria signed a mutual defense agreement with Egypt. Nine days later, Israel attacked the city of as-Samu in the Jordanian occupied West Bank in response to raids from the fedayeen group Fatah. King Hussein of Jordan criticized President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt for failing to come to Jordan\\'s aid and \"\"hiding behind UNEF skirts\"\" [I checked Oren p. 135 and there\\'s no mention of this on that page; please help double check source and find reference - possible later printing is different, I have 2003 first edition].\\n\\nOn 14 May 1967, Nasser began sending Egyptian forces into the Sinai Peninsula. Two days later he requested and obtained the withdrawal of UNEF from Egyptian territory. Israel rejected a proposal to restation UNEF on its side of the border. Egyptian forces replaced UNEF positions at Sharm el-Sheikh in the southern Sinai overlooking the Straits of Tiran. Between 18 and 20 May Israel reiterated declarations made in 1957 that any closure of the Straits would be considered as a cassus belli, or justification for war. Nasser declared the Straits closed to Israeli shipping on 22-23 May. On 1 June, Israel formed a National Unity Government by widening its cabinet, and on 4 June the decision was made to go to war. The next morning, Israel launched Operation Focus, a large-scale surprise air strike that was the opening of the Six Day War.\\n\\nI think following this, since the lede really only mentions the war between Israel and Egypt, there should be a brief discussion of the Jordan and Syria fronts, as well. With this slimmer version, it should be possible to fit that in, at least briefly.

Nice work.\\n\\nSince you don\\'t object, I have added that section back to Little Boy.  That action should not affect its good article status.\\n\\nHere is my reasoning.  That particular bomb design is uniquely associated with the Hiroshima bombing, which, in turn, was largely a public weapon effects demonstration.  Its purpose was to show that a single bomb could duplicate the effects of, say, the Tokyo firebombing which required 279 airplanes and 1,700 tons of bombs.\\n\\nHiroshima was spared any earlier bombing in order to serve as a pristine nuclear bomb target, a situation made possible by its lack of importance as a military target.  The two airplanes that accompanied Enola Gay were there to measure the weapon effects.  Nobody expected the loss of Hiroshima to tip the balance in favor of immediate surrender.  The \"\"shock and awe\"\" was expected to come from observing that it was effect of a single bomb.\\n\\nMost of what we know about nuclear weapon effects comes from an intensive study of Hiroshima.  It was flat urban terrain well protected by natural and artificial firebreaks, and it was enough larger than the total destruction area that the margins of the effects could be precisely measured.  Nothing new was learned from Nagasaki, and no other bombs were tested on live urban targets.  In the many test explosions that followed, large and small, the overpressure and thermal impulse contours were measured, and the Hiroshima effects were extrapolated to estimate the theoretical destruction area.\\n\\nGranted, it was pure happenstance that Little Boy, and not Fat Man, was used at Hiroshima, but since it was this discussion of weapon effects seems appropriate here.   \\n\\n\"', \"For once I agree with Adam.

First, I am not the man (assuming Jesse ragan is male), nor have I met him/her. I began the article because as a professor of typography I felt Ragan's work significant, and that s/he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life. S/he has been several time recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (the national professional organization for graphic designers), Ragan's work has appeared in respected design periodicals, and has lectured on typography at several Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) institutions. \\n\\nSeveral days ago I noticed removal of Ragan's name from credits for typefaces on the Tobias Frere-Jones article. My first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between Ragan and his former employers Hoefler & Frere-Jones, perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion. Mr. Hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that Jesse Ragan was only one of many who worked on the project. That may be the case, but that would not discredit typefaces Ragan has produced entirely on his own, or the two mentions of his contributions to the Archer typeface on the AIGA web site. Clearly, at some point someone at Hoefler & Frere-Jones thought Ragan's contributions significant enough to provide his/her name (and not the rest of that team) to our national professional organization. The fact that Mr./Ms. Ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this. But I have no knowledge of this. I know none of these people personally, and I respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest. My primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers, and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general. Jesse Ragan's work is very solid, even his/her own direct client list is impressive. In the world of typography, apprentices are historically given credit, witness Francesco Griffo who apprenticed to Aldus Manutius. It is my hope that Wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant.\", '\"\\n\\n Re: Coordinator Elections! \\n\\nWell, while I\\'ve been a bit tardy these recent times, yes, I will probably stand again now that the pressures of life are easing off!

This paper talks about the result: the integral over Fermionic fields is defined following Schwinger so that the action principle will work, and the result is that the determinant is in the numerator and not the denominator. This is most of Grassman integration, but without the formal anticommuting variables, which seem to have been introduced by Berezin and Candlin independently (at least according to this source). I did not read the original Berezin articles, only the 1965 textbook, so perhaps they are more complete than I originally thought. If anyone has read these, please include a summary of the contents. The real question, in my mind, is as follows:\\n\\n Feynman's propagator approach only requires that the statistics be correct when permuting the ends of the paths. The rest can be done by summing over particle paths, with appropriate projections to deal with Dirac eqn. So the early authors, between 1948-1954 are all dealing with formal anticommuting variables (no complete theory). This is true of the Schwinger action principle, and to a lesser extent, of Matthews and Salam.\\n Matthews and Salam, like Feynman in his QEDIII paper, treat the sum over histories as green's function manipulations, without trying to formally define a calculus of anticommuting fields. They do define anticommuting sources, and anticommuting field Green's functions, but this is similar to Feynman and Schwinger. It does not have the crucial addition that the algebra of the fields in space-time makes sense, and the Fermi field integral is a sum over intermediate states.\\n Khalatnikov seems to have understood the modern thing: that the Fermionic integral is a concept that is well defined. Unfortunately, I cannot access his paper. If anyone has access, please find out what is in there.\\n Candlin defines the whole thing, in a very modern way. This paper is the best on the subject I have read, but it is similar to Berezin 1964.\\n Berezin has some papers in the 1950s and 1960s, which seem to develop the whole thing indepedently, starting with Khalatnikov's observation. These papers are also crucial- who develops the Fermionic coherent states? And who shows that the Fermionic integral reproduces the sum over intermediate Fermionic states?\\n\\nThe whole thing is somewhat implicit in Matthews and Salam, but also in Schwinger and Feynman. The real important development is the identification of sum-over-intermediate states with grassmann integral.

It says at the top of this article that the article was in need of attention by an expert on this subject, and while I am no expert, I certainly seem to be the closest thing to it that this article has ever seen (with the notable exception of JackLumber).  I think you knew what I meant by that expression, but it\\'s certainly possible that you didn\\'t.\\nFinally, I will respond to your earlier comment that \"\"White South African English\"\" as a title for this article is \"\"simply racist\"\".  You really haven\\'t explained to me how that would be a racist title.  I\\'m going to assume that you meant either: 1.) That title would suggest that only whites in South Africa speak English and absolutely no one else does. 2.) That title would suggest that whites are the most important group in South Africa, they\\'re are better than everyone else, and they are thus the only group in South Africa deserving an article on the type of English they speak.  Both of these choices seem rather absurd to me.  If you thought 1.), then I already proposed a solution for that.  We could give each Indian South African English, Black South African English, and White South African English its own article to show that there are indeed other dialects of English spoken in South Africa besides WSAfE.  If you thought 2.), then you are racist.  Let me explain.  For that title to be racist I would have to be white.  If I were a racist white person I would want that to be the title of the article to show that whites are better and that the way they speak is better.  Since we are both anonymous, however, there is no way you could possibly know my race.  You would have to rely on conjecture.  In this case, your guess was that I was white.  After all, if I were black and I proposed that, I would have to somehow be racist against myself.  What I don\\'t understand for sure is why you assumed I was white.  That\\'s quite a racist assumption.  Anyone in the world can edit Wikipedia; people from all races.  Yet you assumed I was white.  Unless you had statistics to back that assumption up, which you didn\\'t, then that\\'s \"\"simply racist\"\".  Even if you did have statistics to back it up, it still could be racist.  To me, what you\\'re saying is that only white people edit Wikipedia, and that people of other races aren\\'t intelligent enough.  Of course, I don\\'t for sure, but that\\'s my conjecture.   \"', 'See graphe paranomon.', \"Get a psychatrist, moron. \\n\\nYou 9/11 truthers make me sick. paranoid schizophrenics like yourself shouldn't be allowed to use a computer.

If you haven't noticed, a few of their cousins C40LF buses were at the same division they were, since one 5300 series bus was on line 180 in the early 2000s, when it was brand new. So, it wasn't the C40HFs that were at D3, their cousins were, too. \\n\\nYeah, SB-5 division did have a few of the New Flyer D40LF buses (3000-3019) at one time, before they were sent to WSC-6 for almost their whole life, before 3 or 4 units were sent to Veolia Transportation (a bus contractor) in 2009 or 2010.

I\\'ll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:\\n\\n Please don\\'t take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid \"\"academic phrasing\"\" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example \"\"social cost\"\" or \"\"social production\"\".\\n Speaking of \"\"social production\"\" it\\'d be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by \"\"proportions of social production\"\" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you\\'re equivocating between \"\"economic worth\"\" and \"\"social worth\"\" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I\\'m probably coming at this from a different background I\\'m wondering what exactly is the relationship between \"\"social product\"\" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.\\n \"\"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people.\"\" - I\\'m not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really \"\"inherently\"\" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn\\'t seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don\\'t think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern \"\"working class people\"\". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of \"\"economic worth\"\" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.\\n Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren\\'t really related. For example the question \"\"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?\"\" is not obviously or directly related to the question \"\"what was the social power of capital in 1840?\"\".\\n Some ideas for expansion: \"\"Theoretical problems\"\" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). \"\"Wage price series\"\" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I\\'m not sure what a \"\"real price\"\" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there\\'s also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There\\'s also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don\\'t really constitute a series but do provide \"\"snapshot\"\" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.\\n\\nI\\'d really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better.

In his sequence of the Youtube video, the lines are accompanied by rather apt sequences from the anime (among them, the line \"\"When he\\'s underwater does he get wet, | Or does the water get him instead?\"\" is accompanied by a clip of Ed sinking to the bottom of a body of water because of his prosthetic limbs  which happen to be made entirely of metal, hence his title the \\'Fullmetal\\' Alchemist).\\n\\nColonel Roy Mustang (aka the Flame Alchemist) is cast as Triangle Man. Promoted at one point to Brigadier General and later became Fuhrer (sp?), he is constantly taking jabs at Edward (for a rather popular example, he more than occasionally jokes about Ed\\'s height), though in one episode in the anime and a sidestory in the manga the two actually hold a battle on the parade grounds (with the Fuhrer\\'s permission)  Mustang wins by a comeback landslide in the manga, but in the anime the then-Colonel hesitates (possibly due to post-traumatic stress disorder, as surmised due to a flashback being shown at that moment in the anime of a young man he had to kill in the Ishbal War) and thus loses to Ed; it is from the anime episode that the video actually gets the majority of its Particle Man VS Triangle Man footage.\\n\\nMajor Alex Louis Armstrong () is cast as Universe Man; all State Alchemists (such as, as noted before, Armstrong and Edward) carry watches, and in both manga and anime the man proudly brandishes his watch (supplying one shot used in the video if I recall), plus he is, despite his sheer size (he is easily tied with the husband of Izumi Curtis (sp?) as the tallest supporting character in the series) and power (he performs his particular brand of alchemy through the use of powerful punches  one scene in the anime has him pick up a slab of concrete with one hand, toss it in the air, and punch it, thus turning it into a massive bullet propelled at high speed via the punch\\'s force). In the video, his power and compassion are both seen . . . along with his penchant for posing (most likely a trait passed down the Armstrong family line for generations  a lot of his many talents, from his alchemy to his skill at portraiture, seem to be this way).\\n\\nSecond Lieutenant Jean Havoc is cast as Person Man, and aptly so; out of all his co-workers, he seems to suffer the most problems, particularly in his love life  Mustang has effectively stolen every single girl he\\'s dated in either series, anime or manga, with one exception (manga-only) being the homunculus Lust (going under the alias Solaris; admittedly, it was a poor choice, as she later was proved to have been using him and ended up wounding him in his leg to the point that he could not be of any use in the military, hence his subsequent resignation, plus the Flame Alchemist did in fact kill Lust during the same incident where she crippled Havoc). Hence, the line \"\"Triangle Man hates Person Man\"\" is given even more meaning with this Youtube video.

If [WP:VER] is intended to be weaponized then a bot could be made that deletes pages and sections based on whether the section contains an insufficiently prestigious reference.  Treating WP:VER as an intentional algorithm would allow an attacker to delete perhaps as high as 90% of wikipedia without even needing to look at the content.  No one could invoke any objection to the mass deletion if the literal interpretation of WP:VER is the most important rule on wikipedia.  Vandalism becomes impossible if criteria for removal applied to a science page can be robotically applied to a philosophy page.\\n The above attack would meet a common sense interpretation of vandalism.  The only possible protection from the mass deletion attack is if [WP:VAN] is considered to have higher priority for literal interpretation than WP:VER.  There should already be a common sense acceptance that Vandalism is more dangerous and objectively assessed than the quality of referenced material, and as shown above, rejecting the statement binds wikipedia to a suicide pact.  Its my view that the recent deletions are indistinguishable from robotic vandalism and they deleted high quality and verifiable references based only on the content hosting platform.\\n If Vandalism and Verifiability are to be equally considered in actions, then restoring the content and tagging it as needing better sources should be done.

As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (\"\"Hakenkreuz\"\" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\" Wikipedia\\'s liars cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol.

As for the Gujjar issue it is well documented that Jat, Gujjar and the so-called rajputs of northern Punjab are the same people. This leads to the conclusion that maybe the Janjua claim to be rajput is suspect as I have said all along.

Although the Court did not expressly require that a peace officer cite particularized concern for his safety, they did not expressly say that it was unnecessary, either.\\n\\nThe clarification of “federal law” is also important, because the Supreme Court, empowered under Article III of the US Constitution, cannot really grant “authority” to a peace officer; rather, they are limited to interpretation of laws and review for conformance with the Constitution, as they make quite clear in the citation from Mimms.\\n\\nI’ve added a tag to the assertion that state law may not allow drivers or passengers to be ordered to exit the vehicle; though this assertion may be correct, it’s pretty sweeping, and needs support. It may be particularly significant in light of the Death of Sandra Bland. Many pundits have insisted that Ms. Bland’s failure to exit her car when so ordered provided cause for arrest, usually citing Mimms and Miller, and perhaps Texas Transportation Code §542.501. The Supreme Court holdings were of course limited to the Fourth Amendment, and did not (and could not) consider whether refusal to exit a vehicle after being so ordered violated state law; unless the Commerce Clause of Article I is somehow involved (and this seems unlikely), that would be a matter for state legislators to regulate, and state courts to interpret. Some states well may have done so; however, I have been unable to find anything close to dispositive, and have not seen anyone else do so. I am not going to make a project of running this down, but if someone else can provide this information, it would seem a great addition. Hopefully, any such reference would cite real decisional law that is unambiguous to the average reader, rather than a mere assertion by a third party (if the third party cannot cite authority, that party’s assertion is suspect).   \\n\\n “Police” vs. “peace officer” \\nI do not understand the suggestion that “peace officer” or “law enforcement officer” is strictly the proper term needs support; I think the linked WP article makes it quite clear that either of these terms—which refer to a superset of “police officer”—are the strictly correct usage. I used “police” simply because in some other articles, other editors—usually IP—kept changing it to “police officer,” and the bickering seemed a poor use of time. And I reasoned that if the Supreme Court can use “police”—correctly or otherwise—we cannot be faulted for doing so here. Whoever added that tag did not give a reason; absent some good reason to keep it (or perhaps a suggested rewording of the note), I’m inclined to remove the tag.', '\"!

The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.\\n\\nThis is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.\\n\\nIn the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self.

The reason I find it necessary to do this is because some elements of Chang\\'s story, which report claims of the DI have been blithely elevated to facthood, without benefit of a critical examination of the reported claims.\\n\\nHere is my initial draft for the new section, to appear below the biography and above the discussion of the controversial DI petition.\\n\\nControversial New York Times Story\\n\\nIn February 2006, the New York Times ran an investigative story Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition by Kenneth Chang of the New York Times Science Desk, reporting that the Discovery Institute had launched a new websiteDissent From Darwin to promote their expanded public relations campaign regarding how theories of evolution should be taught in public school.  The new website included a list of signatories to an earlier petition which the Discovery Institute had termed \"\"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.\"\"Signatories of \\'A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\\' The petition dated back to 2001 when it was first published by the Discovery Institute beneath an ad criticizing a forthcoming PBS series on evolution.2001 \"\"100 Scientists\"\" Ad]  The headline on the Discovery Institute\\'s 2001 ad was also \"\"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,\"\" although the petition itself, embedded at the bottom of the ad, did not carry that label (it bore no label at all).  The untitled 2001 version of the petition simply read, \"\"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\"\" \\n\\nChang\\'s story disclosed that Professor Picard\\'s name appeared on the petition cited by the newly launched Dissent From Darwin website, but the Times article did not distinguish which version she signed.  Indeed, Professor Picard\\'s name first appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition and her name remained on the subsequent controversially yclept versions, including the most recent one appearing on the new website.  Chang\\'s story neither substantiated nor refuted the claims of the Discovery Institute that the two-sentence petition supported or endorsed DI\\'s slant on its meaning, but the story did include a mixture of quotes from some of the people whose names appeared on the list at different times, including some quotes that cast doubt on the Discovery Institute\\'s characterization of all the petition signers as variously \"\"dissenters from Darwinism\"\" or \"\"anti-evolution.\"\"  Chang\\'s story, in conjunction with the Discovery Institute\\'s website and its attached list of petition signers left a wake of confusion over who among the list of signers of the earlier versions of the petition agreed with or consented to the Discovery Institute\\'s characterization of the petition signers as \"\"anti-evolution\"\" \"\"dissenters\"\" who presumably supported the emerging and evolving agenda of the Discovery Institute.  It is at present unknown to what degree, if any, Picard agrees with or supports the Discovery Institute\\'s controversial interpretation of the petition as \"\"dissent.\"\"  It is also unknown whether Picard has ever supported any or all of the ongoing political agenda of the Discovery Institute.\\n\\nThe last two sentences of the proposed new section reflect the absence of verifiable published information regarding the attitude of most of the original 103 signers.  So far, Wikipedia has only managed to obtain a reliably sourced comment from Stanley N.

There\\'s some info in the Kingdom Hearts (series)#Development section, but it isn\\'t cited. If anyone can find some developer interviews about the game that could be sourced, that would help expand that section.\\n\\nThe manga section is missing information on the Japanese publication/serialization.\\n\\nThere are a few statements that I tagged as citation needed that I wasn\\'t able to find any sources for. Admittedly, I wasn\\'t specifically looking for those information, but nothing came up in my general searches.\\n\\nI\\'m currently trying to find the proper in-game dialog to cite some of the information in the setting and story sections. If any body would like to help, it would be appreciated.\\n\\nOne last thing, if anybody can get information from or has the Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, Kingdom Hearts Ultimania Revised Edition, and/or Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania α ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~, that could help expand and source the \"\"Development\"\" and \"\"Versions and merchandise\"\" sections.\\n\\nI\\'ll keep trying to find information as best I can, but I\\'m having a hard time finding the appropriate information in English, and my Japanese is limited. Any help would of course be appreciated, but if the list above can be addressed, I think it would greatly help in getting this article to \"\"Good Article\"\" status and hopefully eventually \"\"Featured Article\"\" status. ( )\\n\\nGameFAQs has a script and journal text. I can\\'t help you much on the other stuff, as most of the interviews I find are only relevant to the later games and aren\\'t sourced very well. I commend you for your efforts to make a good article.  \\n\\nThanks for the game script link, that made getting the dialog much easier than trying to transcribe it from videos. I tired to find appropriate citations and I feel that the general story is cited well-enough, but others may disagree and add as they see fit.I found a little bit of info for some things and added a reference for one item needing citation, but am still looking for the others. After looking at the Kingdom Hearts#Setting section, I think it may need a rewrite.

To have any credible claim to\\nwork by any principles, a society must show they\\noperate reliably fairly, and to do that means that\\npeople are entitled to it. No way out of that. Hence,\\nas soon as any group tries to follow any policy code\\nlike neutral POV, immediately people are entitled to\\nthings and all things are not dependent on favour. So,\\nit stands absolutely logically proved:\\n\\neither * it\\'s wrong to say to any user ever \"\"you\\'renot entitled to anything\"\",\\n\\nor * it\\'s wrong to say to the public that Wikipedia has a neutrality policy that works.They can\\'t both be right because anyone can see they contradict each other head-on. At least one must be wrong. Which is it?end of copy. Right, what this means is perfectly clear. Unless Wikipedia can answer the question I put there, \"\"which is it?\"\", then Wikipedia is illegal. It\\'s as simple as that, and I\\'m immediately posting so in every single aspie forum I belong to. I will also be asking real-life organisations to file details on it as being part of a hate campaign. The illegality is shared by every person who does not leave Wikipedia. Unless - there is an unless - unless the question is answerable. There are only 2 answers: if it\\'s the second answer, no neutrality policy, then Wikipedia would stand obliged by its own public admission to shut down, while if it\\'s the first answer, the mob is not in charge and people are entitled to things, then this block ends. It\\'s as simple as that.\\nNow, I have a right to challenge the block and this has been the challenge. The block forms part of a group-bullying hate campaign to establish that the mob is in charge, and if that is not the case, Wikipedia has absolutely firmly no other choice than to admit that people are entitled to things, and that inherently means it is not a \"\"legal threat\"\" to say so!!! That means being  entitled \\'\\'\\' to challenge any admin who claims it is.

Could there be a conflict of interest there? If you were to ask me, I'd say that to believe that his opinions represent the opinions of the majority—or even a plurality—is to deceive ourselves. I undeniably profess that he rewards those who show scrupulous adherence to his worldview and punishes those who make his adversarial contrivances understood, resisted, and made the object of deserved contempt by young and old alike.

This unrelenting demand of obedience also implies that you don't need me to tell you that this is not wild speculation. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is documented fact.\\n\\nThis is not to say that Amaury seems to enjoy making unfounded statements and jumping to conclusions.

The best way to do this would be to tag the original webpage with the license that it is being released under.

Naturally English Wikipedia will use mostly English-language sources, and naturally there are a lot of high-quality English-language RSes, and these are sufficient to demonstrate a game's notability, etc., but high-quality or major non-English and multinational sources would address Wikipedia's second pillar by reducing or eliminating cultural biases in the reporting.

(And similarly, reviews from French magazines would be helpful for French games, and Russian magazines for Russian games, etc.).

Nevertheless, because pain can involve sensory, emotional and cognitive factors, it is \"\"impossible to know\"\" when painful experiences may become possible, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established.Johnson, Martin and Everitt, Barry.

It\\'s also way past my bedtime, so, if anyone wants to help out while I\\'m sleeping, be my guest.\\n\\nThe problem is a terminological confusion which arises from using the term pullback for different (but related) things. For f  M → N a smooth map, there is usually not a smooth bundle map from T*N to T*M (unless f is a diffeomorphism). There is a pointwise map of individual cotangent spaces f*p  Tf(p) N → Tp M for every p, defined by operation with the pushforward of a vector in the corresponding tangent space (it is the transpose of the pushfoward on individual tangent spaces). But for the general point q in N we can\\'t pull back to M unless we have a way of choosing a point in f-1(q) (which is especially problematic if f is not onto...). However, we can pull back sections of the cotangent bundle (i.e. covector field, and this applies in general to covariant tensor fields). The \"\"pullback\"\" everyone talks about is a map from covector fields on N to covector fields on M, that is, given ω: N → T*N a section, we define f*ω  M → T*M  by\\n\\nwhere f*p is just the pointwise pullback defined before. This is always well-defined. Note that this is just the opposite of the problem with vectors and their fields (and in general, contravariant tensor fields): in that case, there is a pushforward which is a smooth bundle map of the tangent bundles, but in general vector field does not push forward unless the map is a diffeomorphism. It has been remarked in several books that the co-objects seem to have this wonderful extra structure, of being able to pull back sections. What really happened is that it gave up the capability to induce a smooth bundle map of the bundles in the process, thus restoring one aspect of \"\"duality\"\" that seems to have been broken when dealing with this subject.\"', '21:52, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)', \"LWW was the first written, and first published.

Lot of famous scientist of the era tried to made the mathematical background of the Q.theory but its proved to difficult for them. Neumann redefinied the definitions, he pointed out serials of former serious errors. He made Q. theory to a calculable science which made it a practicable science for industry. He invented the famous game theory and designed the world-famous ENIAC digital computer too.(ENIAC, short for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer,[1][2] was the first general-purpose electronic computer. It was a Turing-complete, digital computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems.[3] ENIAC was designed to calculate artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army\\'s Ballistic Research Laboratory, but its first use was in calculations for the hydrogen bomb. When ENIAC was announced in 1946 it was heralded in the press as a \"\"Giant Brain\"\". It boasted speeds one thousand times faster than electro-mechanical machines, a leap in computing power that no single machine has since matched. This mathematical power, coupled with general-purpose programmability, excited scientists and industrialists.) Neumann was the main mathematican in Manhattan Project. Other famous Hungarian was Jenő Wigner often reffered as the father of quantum mechanics. Other famous Hungarian: Leó Szilárd his invention changed the basis of nuclear science:  he invented the nuclear chain reaction and invented the nuclear reactor (and he invented with Wigner the first nuclear power station) as well as the first Particle accelerator. Therefore the nuclear physics became a practicable/utilizable science for mankind. As the inventor nuclear chain reaction, he realised foremost the atomic-bomb, he made the basic \"\"Cutaway Drawing\"\" of the first atomic bomb. He asked Albert Einstein to write letter to president Roosevelt for the realization of a concrete nuclear Bomb. In Manhattan project dosens of scientist and hundreds of engineers worked for the realization of Szilárd\\'s idea: a working atomic bomb from 1939-1944. An other Hungarian Ede Teller invented the H-bomb. And it is just particle quantum / nuclear physics. It is just a branch of physics.  We had dosens of similar great scientists in other branchs of the physics and natural sciences.\\nThe exaggeratedly anglocentric Rico have never heard about these scientists. The expert historians of natural sciences are always shocked about great number of Hungarian scientists, how is it possible for such a little country.\\n\\nWhat said the Italian Enrico Fermi about Hungarians (the Marthians):  http://www.setileague.org/askdr/hungary.htm\\n\\n  \"', '\"\\n\\nYou are so full of shit. \"\"Legitimate labeling?\"\" First of all, you aren\\'t an admin, and for the sake of this site I hope you never will be.

It\\'s always been my position that it should have a fair trial, but it seems that at every step things have been problematic.  First off, there was the fact it was introduced immediately on the heels of two other major UI changes (the addition of revision deletion to the admin toolkit, and the switchover to Vector).  Then there was the fact that the version on the test wiki was *not* the version to be introduced here, so nobody could even test it properly on the testwiki.  The trial criteria were not developed until just days before the trial itself, and there were no benchmarks set to determine whether or not there was any change over time, or whether that change was positive or negative. The majority of early supporters in the original PC poll wanted it to be focused on BLPs, but for some reason at the end of the poll it was decided that PC should be applied to currently protected or semi-protected articles instead, and those were the articles targeted in the trial. The WMF press on the subject specifically referred to the ability for anonymous and newly-registered users to edit long-time semi-protected articles of high profile topics (the George W. Bush article was specifically mentioned), without discussing this in advance with the community. (It lasted less than 2 days on pending changes, with mountains of vandalism during that period.) Then there was the promise by the lead developer that PC would be shut off at the end of 60 days unless the community clearly requested otherwise. Four days later, when lead developer responsibility changed hands, the new lead developer announced that he would rather keep things running during any review, on a quiet page with only the most interested editors watching.  Even with all of this disarray, I still hoped that we could get a reasonable trial of the tool. It was agreed that we\\'d start off with 2000 articles in the trial, starting with just a few and ramping up so that we\\'d hit the 2K articles around 2 weeks into the trial, with the expectation that if things went well, we\\'d add more incrementally, perhaps up to 10K; however, only a handful of administrators participated in adding articles to the trial, and I don\\'t think we ever got above 1500.  Further, at that point, we\\'d pretty well added all of the articles that were eligible under the criteria for the trial, except for ones in categories where one or more administrator had objected to inclusion; as best I can tell, their objections were based on the articles being honey pots for socks.  I was one of the most active admins in adding articles to the trial, and I confess I sneaked in a pile of BLPs that technically didn\\'t meet the criteria (they had been semi-protected in the previous 6 months and had fewer than 10 watchers). Indeed, one of the most telling factors on this trial was the fact that very, very few administrators appeared to be interested in using the tool as currently configured. I also note that the time that it has taken edits to be reviewed has continued to lengthen as time has gone on. A few weeks ago, I led a panel on the topic of Pending changes at the New York City Wiki-conference. Thanks to DGG, Becksguy and Jamesofur, who were also on the panel.   That same day, keynote speaker Clay Shirky talked about the fact that once a culture is \"\"broken\"\", it is not able to rebound back to its prior state. In my own closing statement, I reflected on that comment, and wondered if pending changes might be the \"\"culture-breaker\"\" for Wikipedia and, if it was, whether or not that would be a good or bad thing. Certainly the manner in which this entire trial has proceeded has shown that there are some pretty huge differences in what people perceive as the way we do things around here. I don\\'t think  the pending changes software or its use will be the culture breaker, but the manner in which it is being integrated and promoted into the project might very well be. I am very considerably concerned that this pressure to keep a bit of trial software running has resulted in a level of divisiveness between good-faith Wikipedians from which the community may not recover.     \"', 'Rollback restored, per your explanation.', 'I agree the enlisting of ministry would be a good idea, analogous to Michelle Lensink.

Even the sources presented here indicate that nuclear\\'s sustainability is under-researched and hinges on too many unknowns to be accepted without further comment. This is true for many areas of sustainable energy research, but especially nuclear. It is an active area of research (or areas, rather) which has a relatively small but extremely vocal core of active supporters.

One day her discomfort and taken so much that she ended up in the emergency room... this is when she found that her bowels had backed up into her system and she was lucky because if was really serious... the only time she had ever dealt with hospitals is with her hearing... she had lost her hearing at four along with being sick all the time... and at 17 had to have implants put in which was a miracle cause it gave her 80% back... but she is still considered hearing impaired... now this is happening to her... she had gained a weight up to 180 and looked very stocky... the doctors didn't know what was wrong with her.... she spent three days being detoxed so to speak... when they didn't know if she had lupus, rheumatoid, but later found traces of cancer in her colon... but she didn't let it get her down.

In 2002 she was honored with several titles in many organizations like Hawaiian Tropic, Venus, Ms Fitness and Sport Aerobics and WTF.. it wasn't til she had heard she was on ESPN2 every month for one year and honored on the front page of her local newspaper and found herself in several articles in OXYGEN. This helped Traci realize that she had potential to earn some actual money in the fitness industry. She kept competing and in April of '2002 moved to an organization which she had heard was tough and very different from others called NPC /IFBB.  This is where Arnold S. Slyvester Stalone and many more came out of you know the BOYS CLUB Once she arrived, competing in her first NPC she had found a very different way they handled threi shows and treated the competitors... Shoop coming from a strong female in charge background family life saw that this was going to be a challenge for her... she had dreamed of maybe getting more exposure and getting the chance to really be friends with some of the hollywood celebrities.  During the time she was studying nutriiton she always had more than several ideas and projects in mind to bring to the future.... now she has alwsy felt competing natural was always her best route and found with no help and little support she was able to conquer her enemies and achieve her goals.  She was always wnadering why thes other girls who seemed to get covers and major sponsors did it... where she found herself funding everything on her little $7 an hour because she as a military spouse never made as much in those cities because the husband was the provider she was tired of the little she wanted bigger she knew that s\", '\", 17 July 2006 (UTC)\\n\\nSomeone above said, \"\"Others might be paid by sponsors (CIA, GM, anyone with money who sees wikipedia as just another propaganda opportunity).\"\"  I have proof of this, particulary people from the CIA, including an administrator.

Additionally (more so in other parts of the world), the terms are used to indicate the change from the historic calendar [for example, the Julian calendar in Europe and the Americas] to the (modern) Gregorian calendar.The October (November) Revolution Britannica encyclopaedia, A demonstration of New Style meaning the Gregorian calendar.Stockton, J.R.

I believe that, properly and historically, the \\'Styles\\' really refer only to the \\'Start of Year\\' change (from March 25th to January 1); and that the \\'Leap Year\\'  change should be described as the change from Julian to Gregorian.\"\"Spathaky, Mike Old Style New Style dates and the change to the Gregorian calendar. \"\"increasingly parish registers, in addition to a new year heading after 24th March showing, for example \\'1733\\', had another heading at the end of the following December indicating \\'1733/4\\'.

We as historians have no excuse for creating ambiguity and must keep to the notation described above in one of its forms. It is no good writing simply 20th January 1745, for a reader is left wondering whether we have used the Old or the New Style reckoning. The date should either be written 20th January 1745 O.S. (if indeed it was Old Style) or as 20th January 1745/6.

That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.\\n\\nAs an example, being Australian I checked his figure for \"\"Australian Jews\"\" in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population.

Marketing professor Peter Fader notes that Wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds, but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information. Joel Waldfogel, professor of business and public policy, agrees that much of the concern about Wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media (printed encyclopedias, in this case) stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media. (quoted from article). In short, no matter what system you come up with here, it is going to be wisdom of the crowd, by design, that is what Wiki is.

I have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her Talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques I have posted there. In my view, Gwen Gale's actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it. I will post the text of the complaint I made below. If you agree that she has acted improperly, please respond saying so. Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.\\n\\nThis is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled “Criticism” in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.\\n\\nHer most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  \\n“single source cited says it's not clear what even happened”\\nI've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) \\nThe grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  \\n\\nThe complaint is based on five points \\n1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”\\nNo complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. \\n2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. “single sourced, anecdotal”, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.\\n3/ Gwen Gale’s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.\\n4/ Gwen Gale’s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia’s policy on Verifiability.\\n5/ Gwen Gale’s comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia’s Biography on Living Persons policy. \\nThe only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale’s conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.\\n\\nGwen Gale’s Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia’s Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing\\nIt is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia’s policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were “anecdotal”, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicle’s assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT.

(Calif) Hip-hop producer and west coast native E. Re-ill debuts his album “Get It”. “Get It” is the representation of E. Re-ill\\'s mindset, \"\"I\\'m in a place in my life where I need to become who I am... I got to “Get It”!!! says E. Re-ill. “Get It” is an album that when focused on can bring out the drive in you to make your dreams real. Why you may ask? You need three things to achieve your goals Hope (expectations), Hustle (drive) and Hunger (appetite for success). These three mindsets are displayed in this album which accompanied by your dreams this will enable your inner being to ““Get It”!” E. Re-ill has been producing beats since the late 80\\'s, influenced by Dr. Dre (and who isn\\'t), Rick Rubin, performed with many stars, and has participated in great projects. A prior and classic venture was with the street-ball company Y.P.A. and the DVD titled \"\"The War\"\". E. Re-ills’ most rememberable time in making music is when N.W.A. was filming the classic controversial video \"\"Straight Outta Compton\"\" E. Re-ill\\'s older brother caught the attention of Ice Cube and filmed Ice Cube telling E. Re-ill to keep up and he\\'ll see him on top!!! That statement would drive E.Re-ill for many years. Hip-Hop has always been the “in touch with your inner voice” music and then we have always informed our community of how we see the actions displayed in front of us. Hip-Hop can be fun, dark, and everything in between. However, usually no matter the topic a hip-hop song it should captivate you!!! “Get It” is no exception to this, “Get It” displays emotional drive, creative sound packages, consistent vibe and sounds, and arguably some of the best lyrics delivered on hip-hop tracks in a long while. Songs like \"\"Dark People\"\" a description of pushing your self to great heights even when life shorts you of opportunities. \"\"I\\'m So Gangsta\"\" is a nice surprise!!! It is Fresh Caesar\\'s look at the world biggest gangsta George Bush, and his fumbles with war and Katrina!!! Don\\'t cheat yourself I\\'m so Gangsta is a necessary download!!! Oakland native and a brilliant lyricist Fresh Caesar (a.k.a. Omega) is currently working on his own album titled \"\"Jack London’s Square\"\". Fresh Caesar displays lyrical strengths of Nas and Jay-Z with a west coast flavor delivery. Fresh Caesar displays great lyrical ability and is definitely not your average rapper on the mic. Down South/Oakland rapper, Tom-E-Gunn has the sounds of Snoop Dogg\\'s early gangsta swag with grit of the south. These songs are actually lost demos recently found. E. Re-ill felt compelled to use the demos for the world to hear due to their strong delivery of life experiences. E. Re-ill\\'s “Get It” album is about all the aspirations that we desire in life money, success, respect, reflections of life, and excess of women and parties. This is the start of great things to come from this talented producer. iTunes search E.Re-ill (no spaces), Contact: myspace.com/ereill1 Also available on rhapsody, emusic, napster, Amazon...\"', '\":Kitty - I will do that when I get a \"\"round tuit.\"\" I also think a paragraph about Ohio\\'s John Fowler is in order.  \\n\\n\"', 'You should seriosly look into reading and applying it yourself.', 'Yes, I saw dear old Slim Virgin on the war path again, must be tres difficult for her.

The trial, which has received extensive cover in the media, deals with issues for which BP has already pleaded guilty, and faces fine of up to $20 billion. The presence of other articles is immaterial. This is a very serious trial, and it behooves us to mention it to readers, and state what is at stake. Failure to do so would be a serious NPOV violation, as is the fact that the legal jeopardy that BP faces is not mentioned in the article thanks to the recent edits, an I have so tagged the article.\\n\\nOn the figure, the BP Corporate editor monitoring the article on the talk page here has indicated that other sourcing states that the actual figure of BP\\'s exposure from this trial is really $17 billion, not $ 20 billion.

It contains many references.\\n\\nWhy Korean comfort women during Korean War and why Korean collaborators? Because it is true. It all happened and it was all discuss probably before you were born. So we look to the academics and newspapers for reference.\\n\\nFrom, The Construction of US Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Transformation and Resistance by Lee, Na Young, 2006\\n \\n\\'The term “comfort women” (wianbu) to refer to military prostitutes serving American soldiers signals the widespread acceptance of camptown prostitution as an inevitable means to entertain foreign soldiers. This term was commonly used in newspaper articles throughout the 1950s along with such phrases as “prostitutes catering to UN soldiers” and terms like yanggongju (Western princesses), or “UN madams” (woman getting a livelihood by serving UN soldiers).129 This usage continued during the 1960s and 1970s when camptown prostitution became more differentiated from non-U.S. military prostitution.  The Korean government’s policy on prostitution reflected its public’s perspectives on prostitution, which was, in the decades after the war, regarded as a necessary means to feed Korea’s impoverished population.\\'\\n\\nThe Chosun Ilbo or Daily News is major newspapers in South Korea 2,200,000 readers. Examples given are in Chosun Ilbo 23 August, 1960, it mentions, \"\"In Pup’yLng, some 150 \\'comfort women dealing with American troops\\'. Similar reports using the words \"\"comfort women\"\" are: KyLnghyang Ilbo, 11/25/1955; Chosun ilbo, 11/08/1957; Chosun ilbo, 8/23/1960; Chosun ilbo, 12/03/1963. A “Comfort Women’s demonstration” is also reported in 1966. \\n\\nIn the mid- to late-1960s, there were numerous articles in Chosun ilbo reporting crimes committed against camptown prostitutes by American soldiers that continued to used the term \\'comfort women\\'. Korea college girls recruited for the Nangnang Club were also viewed as \"\"yanggongju\"\" or comfort women (Seoul Sinmun 26 July, 1952; 10 October, 1953). Post-war military brothels were still known as comfort stations and the system based on the Japanese one.\\n\\nIn 1958, the Chosun ilbo also accounts for the number of women involved as 300,000. The women who served “one American husband” were called “yangbuin” (Western madam) instead of the usual \"\"yanggalbo\"\" (western whore) who were generally treated by Korean society as “non-human beings”. Generally, the Yanggongju have been ignored in official Korean histories as a national shame until recent. \\n\\nSong-gun Chong in 1967 wrote, 3,000 so-called “comfort women” registered with the  Health Section of the Military and the Military Police Corps of the U.S. Army (“Current Situations of Korean Prostitutes and Countermeasures.” Pophak-nonchong 8:65-87.) \\n\\nYou can download the main reference at http://www.lib.umd.edu/drum/bitstream/1903/4162/1/umi-umd-3959.pdf\\n\\nReferences also arise in Yi, Imha. 2004a.

Takagi and Hye Jung Park. 1995. 60 minutes. VHS?\\n\\nMany of Korean women were also forced, tricked, financial compromised or even kidnapped into sexual slavery for American troops in South Korea. As example, the documentary features Yang Hyang Kim, who \"\"applied for a job in what she thought was a coffee house, only to be sold to a brothel outside Camp Stanley\"\".\\n\\nSame as Japanese Imperialists before them. They both documents how the Korean and American governments were involved, how Korean officials portrayed the women as “personal ambassadors” fulling their patriotic duty to nation by sexually servicing soldiers. The rape and murder of women by the pimps and the soldiers.\\n\\nIt says. \"\"Drawing upon interviews and testimonies, emphasize that many of the women who \"\"serve\"\" the US military as so-called voluntary sex workers were in fact recruited in the same brutal ways as were their earlier counterparts in Japan\\'s \\'comfort system\\', that is, through coercion, trickery, and even force - because both Korean and American governmental interests have viewed men\\'s access to female bodies for R & R as so crucial to military morale.\"\"\\n\\n Priorend  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  \"', 'By the way, please join my Royal Militia. details are on my userpage.', 'You are wrong my friend.

Yet you have the arch hypocrisy to highlight the \"\"assume good faith\"\" legend on your page.\\n\\nWell I do have some questions about wikipedia policy, as you mention it:\\n\\n1) Is it an acceptable practice for a wikipedia adminstrator to delete articles which are in the very process of being written without consultation or clarification on the basis that they do not contain references when the very same administrator has himself posted less relevant articles which do not contain references himself?\\n\\n2) If the answer to the above is yes (and I have to conclude that it is, as that is precisely what has happened) would it be fair to conclude that wikipedia administrators feel themselves above and not subject to the same criteria for notability and verification as non-administrators? After all, my article contained no references and was deleted. NawlinWiki`s contained no references and was amended when I pointed it out. Please refer me to the relevant pages. Kont Dracula (talk) \\n\\n1. Yes, to the first part of the question; administrators can delete articles without consultation or clarification. Articles that are being considered for deletion are assessed entirely on their own terms, and not with reference to any other article, so comparison of your article (which I have read) with any article created or edited by anyone else is not a relevant consideration. You can read the relevant policy at WP:WAX. \\nWell I didn`t expect you to be so candid about it. So you believe that it is entirely acceptable for an administrator to completely ignore the very regulations that he is so dogmatically enforcing onto others. You still haven`t referred me to the \"\"relevant\"\" page on that one.\\n\\nBut no, you have not \"\"read\"\" my article because it was in the very process of being written when it was deleted. I am sure that there was a great deal of improvement that it required. There were some slightly whimiscial and humourous details which were possibly not appropriate for a wikipedia entry. It wasn`t perfect. You see, that is why I was editing it and indeed still writing it.\\n\\nOf course, in reality we know that you have not actually expressed your own opinion. You were pretty forward with your opinion the other day though, weren`t you? You described other people`s articles as \"\"steaming shit\"\".

What you wrote here was rubbish. All the main battle tanks in the world are not air mobile capable: No helo designed or in service anywhere in the world can carry them. Nor can they be parachuted...too heavy. All these MBT's including the Merkava, can fit aboard the C-5 Galaxy and C-17 Globemaster air transports to be airlifted anywhere on the globe. The Merkava Mk 4 has a 1500hp GD833 Diesel Engine and additional armor, especially up top, for urban battlefields. Ever been to the Holy land? You get all types of terrain there, not the stereotypical desert/arabian landscape that is always seen on TV. There are forests and swamps in Israel, and up north the terrain is especially rough and it snows too. What consensus are you talking about? Israel has had more battlefield experience with the use of armor and armored warfare in general than any country on this planet. The weight of the Merkava Mk 4 is approximately the same as the M1A2SEP. It has more crew protection than the Leopard tank and has an active self-defense system. It also retains the 60mm Mortar which can be fired under armor. BATTLEFILED MOBILITY of the Merkava series of tanks is better than both the M1 and the Leopard. It is true that both tanks are faster than the Merkava but the Merkava was designed with emphasis on crew protection, survivability and firepower, over speed. The Merkava is more survivable in a firepower-saturated environment meaning it can go places the M1 and Leopard cannot. For this reason the Merkava has more freedom to maneuver, which gives more options to it's operators and commanders, and allows more aggressive courses of action. The enemy cannot simply deny areas to the Merkavas by firepower, meaning the Israeli tank has better battlefield mobility than the Abrams and Leo 2.\", 'Please do, all you will find is that novaseminary has a very bad history of edit warring, pov editing, and being uncivil.', \"The article says 'As a military action, Khe Sanh was a tactical failure, but is viewed by some as a strategic or at least psychological victory.' - insofar as the NVA, this is possibly true (I would not go so far as to say it was a psychological victory, but with the weasel words 'viewed by some' it is hard to argue with).\", \"In all fairness to the article and to it's accuracy shouldn't this be noted?\", '\"\\n\\n legends pertaining to Mucalinda \\n\\nI have heard and read from several sources a story which elaborates on the Mucalinda legend.

A similar case existed in Belarus, but much more amplified, when the changes of 1930s and subsequent orthographic reforms were very noticeable it affected the way whole cities were spelled. Example Minsk and Mensk. In fact that is the reason why there are two versions of Belarusian edition wikipedia, one uses the old and the other the official adopted version. In Ukrainian language a similar happened but to lesser extent, and only some cities were affected e.g. Rivne became Rovno, Luhanske became Luhansk, Konotip became Konotop and so on. With our city as far as I am aware it too became Мукачево. During the 1990s some of those changes were reversed, and it really falls to because in Ukrainian there are sufficient differences between dialects, in fact if you compare western and central Ukrainian the differences would be more vivid than that of British and American English. So for some cases like Rivne, it was much up to the locals, because Volhynian dialect pronounces the city like its spelled, whilst somewhere in Poltava they will say it as Rovno. It seems that with Mukhachevo it is a case that the version used by locals is not entirely adopted nationwide. But then again there are some silly people in the government who use spellings such as Sevatopil but that is outright stupid, because even in classic orthography that version would never be used. The -pil originates from the connotation of field like Ternopil. The -pol comes from the Greek root for city, like Sevastopol.

Why is Maryland the focus of this brigade when other state intros are equivalent? I’ve avoided posting in these discussions because it seems you guys are reluctant to seeing the truth and now I have to write a book to get my point across. Even still you will believe what you want to because of personal preference or you don’t “feel it belongs”. Most of all I’m sure you could care less about the state itself otherwise you wouldn’t object. But you want an answer so here it is...\\n\\nIf you think the intro to the Maryland page needs a rework then you have your work cut out for you because you’re going to have to change just about every other state. Case in point, this is the last paragraph from the Commonwealth of Virginia intro, \\n\\n \"\"Virginia is known as the \"\"Mother of Presidents\"\", because it is the birthplace of eight U.S. presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Woodrow Wilson), more than any other state. Most of the United States\\' early presidents were from the state. Virginia has also been known as the \"\"Mother of States\"\", because portions of the original Colony subsequently became Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and West Virginia as well as some portions of Ohio.\"\"\\n\\nHow is that anymore relevant than proclaiming \"\"Maryland donated the land for Washington, D.C.\"\"? Doesn\\'t talk about presidents from decades past and ceding portions of land belong in the History section according to you?\\n\\nNot convinced? Here’s part of the intro from the State of Wisconsin, this should put your economic fears to rest,\\n\\nWisconsin\\'s rural economy was originally based farming (especially dairy), mining, and lumbering. In the 20th century tourism became important, and many people living on former farms commuted to jobs elsewhere. Large-scale industrialization began in the late 19th century in the southeast of the state, with the city of Milwaukee as its major center. In recent decades, service industries, especially medicine and education, have become dominant. Wisconsin\\'s landscape, largely shaped by the Wisconsin glaciation of the last Ice Age, makes the state popular for both tourism and many forms of outdoor recreation.\\n\\nIn previous version they were proclaiming fur trade!!! But it\\'s a sin to proclaim the life sciences which has become the foremost important industry in Maryland right now?\\n\\nDidn’t get the message? Try the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\\n\\nDuring the 19th century, Massachusetts transformed itself from a mainly agricultural economy to a manufacturing one, making use of its many rivers for power to operate factories for shoes, furniture, and clothing. Its economy declined in the early twentieth century when industry moved south in search of cheaper labor. A revitalization came in the 1970s when, nourished by the graduates of the area\\'s many elite institutions of higher education, the Boston suburbs (particularly those around Route 128) became home to dozens of high-technology companies. Massachusetts\\' colleges and universities, as well as its technology sectors, continue to thrive.\\n\\nThe state is also considered a haven for progressive, liberal thought and often sends political candidates to the national scene, however, the four most recent presidential aspirants, Ted Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, and John Kerry, were all unsuccessful. . Massachusetts was the home state of US Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Calvin Coolidge, and John F. Kennedy, and the birth state of George H. W. Bush.\\nAs of 2006, Massachusetts is the only state in the union to legalize marriage of gay and lesbian couples.\\n\\nMust I continue?

This all seems like a big stretch to formulate a grand conspiracy theory where there isn\\'t any. Editors were aware of the COI back when it happened (years ago) and dealt with it.  The article is edited and watched closely now. \\n\\nAre the only recent edits those three attempted additions to the Barack Obama article? Hardly a high crime it seems to me.  What you\\'re really upset about is that someone did an unfavorable (but accurate) story about how all attempts to include any mention of controversies or criticisms in the Obama article were reverted. News flash, many of us have had the exact same experience this editor had. If we block users for editing under \"\"false pretenses\"\" so be it, but lots of editors post on other sites about their experiences here. This hardly seems like some grand scheme to bring Wikipedia to its knees.  \\n\\nThis check user investigation, however, and the AfD certainly look like an overeaction that only adds fuel to the fire. Klein said he asked someone to make the edits to see what would happen. He reported on the experience and those he witnessed of other attempts to edit the page that are easily viewed through the history.  This hardly seems like something worth making a federal case over. The only mischaracterization is yours: \"\"under false pretenses to incite a block and, through off-wiki agitation, bring disrepute on the project and trigger a major meltdown on the Obama page.\"\" The fact is the editor in question arranged for an attempt to make a reasonable edit to grotesquely biased article and reported on the experience.  That it\\'s not favorable to Wikipedia is certainly cause for reflection and consideration of how we can improve our handling of issues like this in the future.  I know when something messed up is noted on another site and people here are made aware of it there\\'s usually an effort to fix it.  That happened in this case, but the guardians of the Obama page made sure nothing changed.  So be it.

All I have done is put the 3 basic colors Black, Red and White of Roc Nation on a original Wikipedia column to distinguish it from other record label albums discography and the other names of the artists that are on the article, because the article would grow as those and more artist release more studio albums and mixtapes, which makes it appropriate and not inappropriate as you have stated for you reason of adding cleanup/reorganize tags. Once again all I did is add 3 basic colors to the original columns Black, Red and White which anybody can do on any other record label discographies on Wikipedia, but I may have been the first to do this new color scheme styling of a record label studio album discography that does not mean you just add tags that are not meant to be on a specific article that is formatted, organized and written like any other record label albums discographies on Wikipedia and is fully verified.\\n\\nThere is no Wikipedia rule that says this is not justified for a record label studio album discography except for you , I'm sure you're a really nice guy, but this just plain bias, which Wikipedia does not condone from established editors or administrators.\", 'haha it is soo funny\\nand thats why im keeping it on the page.', '\"\\nWhat does the \"\"in two weeks\"\" refer to, Ari?  \"', '\"\\nBlocked indef.  —  • Talk •  \"', '\"\\n\\n ha I thought you knew it was me!   i guess logging in would make it more clear, though its not tantamount to brave public speech if i use a name like limpdaddy.  anyway, i was not gaming you into 3R block and got one myself after reverting bigdaddys \"\"clarification\"\".    thanks for the colon advice, I thought there would be someway to do it once per edit.\\n about reverts, not every revert is POV, but for nearly every post/revert  pair there will be one party that sees the action as POV.   if you\\'re looking for them they are easy to find.\\n re: your editing history, if i\\'m not mistaken, you continued to remove references to bill maher making jokes about their sexual relations, but leave those about their being \"\"friends\"\".\"', '\"==DJ Sammy==\\nCan I please suggest you read Wikipedia:Five pillars before proceeding further.

Clearly, he was caving in to Turkish pressure.

The great advantage of a grav-locked planet is its stability. I think it\\'s fair to say that stability is easier for life to deal with than instability. If you look at the stability of Jupiter\\'s great red spot (400 years and posited to be permanent), weather on a grav-locked planet should be relatively stable, I presume a convection rising at the \"\"sun pole\"\" and falling at the \"\"dark pole\"\", with terrain eddies, of course. Such a planet will have no axial tilt, no day/night cycleI don\\'t even think it can have an eccentric orbit, but I\\'m unsure. This greatly reduces the complexity of an organism\\'s job: for example a plant doesn\\'t need the night \"\"mode\"\" earth plants need; they would not have to drop leaves for winter. These seem like advantages to me.\\n\\nBased on the best information I can find on the US Dept. of Energy site (solar information), what plants get on a clear equinox day is about 8 kWH/m^2, peaking at 1 kW/m^2. The vast majority of that power comes in the middle 8 hours, less than 1 kWH/m^2 is in morning and evening. The night is essentially 0 kWH/m^2not absolutely, no, but to the 2 digit accuracy I was using, yes. (Compare visual magnitudes of sun vs. moon.) This varies by latitude and season, of course. Now let\\'s plug this into the supposedly horrible 60-200% variation of a red dwarf. Instead of roughly 1/3 time at 1 kW (yes, it really is close to that), equivalent energy would be all the time at 1/3 kW. Thus, the variation would be 1/5 kW during minimums (=60% of 1/3 kW) and, of course, 200% is 2/3 kW. Thus, ignoring frequency, the red dwarf plant has an easier time. The lower power of red dwarfs just pull the HZ in. Considering Earth shade plants, which live on far less than 1 kW/m^2, the HZ is where the total solar and gravitational energy are right for water.\\n\\nOrganizationally, perhaps the best thing would be to treat Earth-like planets in the main flow of the article: then discuss tidally-locked red dwarf planets, with a note that thinking on the issue is in flux; and note that chemosynthsis biospheres would be possible even around brown dwarfs or outlying moons, like Titan and Europa. Perhaps (keeping original numbers):\\n\\n1 Suitable star systems\\n\\n 1.1 Spectral class\\n 3.1 Binary systems (since all but the closest binaries are ok, put it here)\\n 1.2 A stable habitable zone\\n\\n2 Planetary characteristics\\n\\n 2.1 Mass\\n 1.3/2.2 Acceptable energy variation (as I hope I showed about, \"\"low\"\" isn\\'t really necessary; include the case of Jovian moons in the HZ)\\n 1.4 High metallicity (it comes from system formation but it\\'s a planet property)\\n 2.3 Geochemistry (maybe combine with metallicity?)\\n\\n3 Alternative biologies\\n 3.2 Red dwarf systems (tidally locked; low light?)\\n NEW Chemosynthesis-based biology.\\n\\n4 on, no changes.\\n\\nI should add, this is a really good article. Maybe I\\'m trying to gild the lily.\\n\\n Mistake ? \\nI am not a specialist but \"\"Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere [10].\"\" (mass paragraph) seems doubtful to me. I mean, Mars still has volcanoes (Mount Olympus for example) so it sees strange to me that it\\'s geologically dead, but once again I am no specialist.  \\n\\nMars does have volcanoes, but as far as I know, they\\'re not really active, so nothing is really \"\"powering them\"\" and geological activity isn\\'t really showing up.   \\nLuna, Earth\\'s Moon has volcanoes, and it\\'s accepted as geologically dead.

At least they have ingredient lists on the bottles, and there are a lot of official documents on those additional ingredients.\\nBut kimchi is a different story. Like I said, I have never seen any packaged/jarred kimchi labeled \"\"unfermented\"\", maybe except for Japanses \"\"kimuchi\"\" which is more like pickled vegetables. And both traditional and contemporary kimchi is fermented. (they are not much different anyway.)

French people often refer to Metropolitan France as L\\'Hexagone (The \"\"Hexagon\"\") because of the geometric shape of its territory.\\n\\nUnless it was a Frenchman or Frenchwoman who added that in, how can we know for certain that they really do? Is this self-made nickname for that region so internationally renowned that it\\'s a surefire fact? Unless one can respond in the affirmative to either question, It needs a citation.\\n\\n2. There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca.\\n\\nAnother proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language, Frank means free as opposed to slave. This word still exists in French as franc, it is also used as the translation of \"\"Frank\"\" and to name the local money, until the use of the Euro in the 2000s.\\n\\nHowever, rather than the ethnic name of the Franks coming from the word frank, it is also probable that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks, the connection being that only the Franks, as the conquering class, had the status of freemen. In German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means \"\"Realm of the Franks\"\". In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, Modern France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Realm is called Frankenreich.\\n\\nNow here we\\'re talking about cite-cite-cite-for-crying-out-loud-cite!

[Additional statements.] \\nThe sum of a thousand pounds, or crowns, was given by the King of England for the surrender of the Maid; and an annuity of 300 pounds to the soldier of the Duke of Burgundy who had captured her. \\n\\nI was appointed notary in the Trial, together with a certain Guillaume Boisguillaume. \\n\\nThe copy of the Process was shown to me is the true Copy made. I acknowledge my own and my companion\\'s signatures, and that it is the truth. Two other copies were made. One was given to the Inquisitor, one to the King of England, and one to the Bishop of Beauvais. This Process was made from a certain Minute written in French, by my own hand, which was given up to the Judges, and was afterwards translated from the French into Latin by Monsieur Thomas de Courcelles and myself, in the form in which it now stands, as well and as faithfully as possible, long after the death and execution of Jeanne. As for the Act of Accusation and other parts of the Process, Maitre Thomas de Courcelles had very little to do with these, nor did he greatly interfere with them. \\n\\nWith regard to the word Nota, written above certain Articles in the Minute, there was, on the first day of the Inquiry, a great tumult in the Chapel of the Castle at Rouen, where, that day, the interrogation was held, so that Jeanne was interrupted at almost every word, while she was speaking of her apparitions: Certain secretaries were there-two or three-of the King of England, who registered, as they chose, her words and depositions, omitting all her defense and all which tended to exonerate her. I complained of this, saying it was irregular, and that I would not be responsible, as clerk, in this matter: and, therefore, on the morrow, the place of meeting was changed and convened in a certain hall of the Castle, near the Great Hall, while two English were placed to keep order. When there were difficulties as to Jeanne\\'s answers, and some said she had not replied as I had written, I wrote Nota at the top, in order that the questions might be repeated and the difficulties removed. Although it is mentioned in the Process that the Judges stated they had received preliminary evidence, I do not remember to have seen or heard of it; but I know that, if it had been produced, it would have been inserted in the Process. \\n\\nJeanne was brought to Rouen and not to Paris, because, as I think, the King of England and the principal people of his Council were there. \\n\\nAt the beginning of the Process, I was sent for to attend a meeting held at a certain house near the Castle, at which were present the Bishop of Beauvais, the Abbe\\' of Fecamp, Maitre Nicolas Loyseleur, and many others. The Bishop told me it was necessary that I should serve the King: that they meant to bring a fine case against this said Jeanne, and that I was to recommend another greffier to assist me. I therefore nominated Boisguillaume. \\n\\nI met Lohier in the Church, on the day after the Bishop had asked him to give an opinion on the Process, and inquired what he you ght of it. He replied, that the Process was of no value, and could not be maintained, because it was conducted in the Castle and not in a legal court; that it concerned many who were not summoned; that Jeanne had no Counsel: and for many other reasons. He added that, in his opinion, it was their intention to put her to death. \\n\\nA certain Maitre Nicolas de Houppeville was summoned to attend the Trial; and was in great danger, because he refused. Maitre Jean Lemaitre, Sub-Inquisitor, delayed as long as possible his attendance at the Trial, and was much vexed at being compelled to attend. \\n\\nOne day, when Jeanne was being questioned, Jean de Chatillon spoke in her favor, saying that she was not compelled to reply to the question put to her, or to that effect. This much displeased the Bishop of Beauvais and his following, and there was a great tumult at his words. The Bishop ordered him to be quiet, and to let the Judges speak. \\n\\nOn another occasion, when some one was advising and directing Jeanne on the question of submission to the Church, the Bishop said, \"\"Hold your tongue, in the devil\\'s name!\"\" I do not remember the name of him who was thus spoken to. \\n\\nOne day, some one, whose name I do not remember, having spoken of Jeanne in a way which did not please the Earl of Stafford, the latter followed him, sword in hand, to some place of sanctuary; and, if they had not told Stafford that that place was sacred, he would have slain him. \\n\\nThose who seemed to me most affected [against Jeanne] were Beaupere, Midi, and de Touraine. \\n\\nOne day, I went with the Bishop of Beauvais and the Earl of Warwick to the prison where Jeanne was, and we found her in irons. It was said that at night she was fastened with iron chains; but I did not see her so fas', \"don't pretend i was attacking a group. i was raising a legitimate question about whether someone in canada knew enough about the topic to edit.  that would apply just as much in reverse. in fact, they clearly didn't know enough. but pls don't let the facts get in the way of the campaign now under way.\", \"Thanks for the revert \\n\\nHey, I just wanted to say thanks for reverting my user page after Gmaxwell deleted it.

For someone who is not German this may not be clear, but the first paragraph states intentions, not facts. In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing. If you want to do a literal translation, the upper version is closer to the original, while the press office version is closer to the meaning.  \\n\\n Diverse errors and unencelopedic context use \\n\\nI would like to ask this whole article to be checked through. While most of it seems all right, there are passages that make no sense, lack imporatant information or are plain wrong. Examples: First paragraph of Drafting process is\\nThe outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.\\nWhile the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:\\nAny war could and should be categorised as an \"\"atrocity\"\" but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....\\nUnverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.\\n...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.\\nWhile it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.\\nDirectly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

After all, much of the European population has at least some Mongolian ancestry, as do Iranians, Turks, Central Asians, and so on - and Uyghurs are certainly included in this distribution regardless of their \"\"Caucasoid traits.\"\" And if you go back far enough, I suppose the entire world population has African ancestry.

What was the Czech political-cultural context, and how did this produce the magazine? \"\"Conservative\"\" is too vague - I think readers will benefit from being told more about Czech conservatism. Then there\\'s the magazine itself; who started it (and what were they doing before this?); editorial policy, contributors, transfer of ownership (if any) and whether or not the magazine has changed since its acquisition by the media group. \\n\\nPut it this way: certainly in the UK (and probably in the US), an award for growing the best cannabis plant isn\\'t something usually associated with a conservative magazine...  \\n\\nI\\'ll put this page on my watch-list.

I\\'m trying to use only sources independent on the magazine itself, and unfortunately the sources deal mainly with controversies. There is an overview of the history of Reflex in the 20th anniversary issue, I\\'ll try to expand the article with that information and answer your questions. Btw, Reflex is sometimes really considered as a conservative magazine; could there be a little difference between the perception of the term in the professional and well-developed Anglo-American journalism and the perception of still \"\"young\"\" independent Czech journalism? Using of this term in the post-communist world is quite complicated, as conservatism defends traditional values and continuity, and the first free post-communist media (including Reflex) had to start building again; to some extent they had to find the values and the interrupted tradition. The provocative cannabis award could be an attempt to test the borders of freedom of speech and to come closer to independent and bold journalism. This is, however, just my vague point of view. We should probably avoid this association on English Wikipedia, as this is a world grown in a completely different tradition and experience. Again, thanks for pointing out the problems.

Do you support bad history?', '\"\\n\\n News suppressed on Wikipedia http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html \\n\\nRexCurry.net is the historian who made the following discoveries covered elsewhere and on Wikipedia:\\n\\n1. The USA’s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers\\' Party (Nazis).  It was not an ancient Roman salute.  http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html\\n\\n2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html\\n\\n3. The Pledge’s creator was a self-proclaimed socialist in the nationalism movement in the USA and his dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and his Pledge was the origin of their salute. \"\"Nazi\"\" means \"\"National Socialist German Workers\\' Party.\"\" A mnemonic device is the swastika (Hakenkreuz in German).  Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist.\"\"\\nhttp://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html\\n\\nThe Pledge is part of the USA’s growing police-state.  The insane government in the U.S. could cause comatose persons to Pledge dis-allegiance, desecrate the flag, and recite a declaration of independence. Remove the Pledge from the flag, remove flags from schools, remove schools from government.\\n\\nAs a libertarian lawyer, Rex Curry provides pro bono services nationwide in schools and elsewhere, to educate the public about the news.\\n\\nGovernment schools will never teach children about their Pledge rights, nor the truth about the Pledge and its author.\\n\\nMost comments fail to ever mention that Francis Bellamy and his cousin Edward Bellamy were National Socialists in the USA, wrote for and supported their \"\"Nationalist\"\" and \"\"New Nation\"\" magazines, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association\"\" and pushed their totalitarian dogma in their \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide, including in Germany, and that the bible of their movement, Edward Bellamy\\'s book \"\"Looking Backward\"\" was translated into every major language including the languages of those countries that became home to totalitarian socialism and the socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part) under the National Socialist German Workers\\' Party (21 million dead), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (62 million dead), and the Peoples\\' Republic of China (35 million dead).  It is easy to see why anyone would want to cover all of that up, but it should not be covered up.\\n\\nIn the USA, the Bellamy dogma supported a government takeover of education.  The government\\'s schools imposed segregation by law and taught racism as official policy.  The USA\\'s behavior was an example for three decades before the Nazis. As under Nazism, the Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and blacks and the Jewish and others in the USA attended government schools that dictated segregation, taught racism, and persecuted children who refused to perform the straight-arm salute and robotically chant the Pledge. Some kids were expelled from government schools and had to use the many better alternatives.  There were acts of violence. When Jesse Owens competed in the 1936 Olympics in Germany, his neighbors attended segregated government schools where they saluted the flag with the Nazi salute.  The U.S. practice of official racism even outlasted the horrid party.  And the schools and the Pledge still exist. The Pledge is still the most visible sign of the USA\\'s growing police state.  \\n\\nAfter segregation in government\\'s schools ended, the Bellamy legacy caused more police-state racism of forced busing that destroyed communities and neighborhoods and deepened hostilities.\\n\\nBellamy was a self-proclaimed national socialist in the USA, with the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, and he preached what he called \"\"military socialism.\"\"  The federal flag darkens schools because Bellamy wanted government to take over all schools and to eliminate all of the better alternatives.  Worse, Bellamy wanted the government to take over everything, not just schools. He wanted the government to impose the military system on all of society. School flags are a symbol of  nationalization, militarism, and socialism.\\n\\nThe Bellamy dogma was the same dogma that led to the \"\"Wholecaust\"\" (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million killed under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million under the Peoples\\' Republic of China; 21 million under the National Socialist German Workers\\'', '\"From their website:\\n\"\"In 1965 Rudolf Schenker started up the SCORPIONS in Hanover. \"\"\\nLink: http://www.the-scorpions.com/english/history.asp\\n\\n\"', '\"\\n\\nMultiple languages\\nEthnologue states that what this article refers to as \"\"dialects\"\" are actually seperate languages.

If an administrator has not acted already by this point, then action is very likely, especially if a report is made to the noticeboard. Policy forbids edit warring generally, and editors may be blocked if they edit war, with or without breaching 3RR. \"\"\\n\\nI commend  for taking the actions he did.  The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.\\n\\nAfter Malke\\'s block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I\\'d welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   \\n\\nOn closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke\\'s biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   \\n\\nHaving just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke\\'s concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   \\n\\nMalke\\'s concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke\\'s talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):\\n\\n   \\n   \\n- *An impartial administrator just did; I don\\'t know you from Adam, and haven\\'t so much as looked at the contents of your edits; all that matters is that you broke WP:3RR, and received a short block for it; if you want to be unblocked, all you have to do is agree to stop edit warring, regardless of whether you think it is justified or not. :==( o ) \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'I highly commend the admins, and urge others to support their work.

To be honest, I don't see big differences in behaviour of editors by nationality, so far as nationality is apparent - I suspect that there are just more Americans here than any other nationality, simply due to sizes of populations of English-speakers, so any group of editors is likely to have more Americans than anything else, including the helpful, constructive, thoughtful ones. I think, however, that there are a higher proportion of editors here now than ever before who have little interest in adding and improving content, preferring to delete, argue, try to raise the bar on notability and fair use guidelines to allow more to be deleted, etc., but I don't see this as a wholly US phenomenon.  08:15\", \"Your discarding of vandalism complaints \\n\\nRe a recent vandalism report I submitted , the user in question has received numerous complaints, including from bots, and has resumed the same independent activity after being blocked a couple weeks ago.

Sadly, you appear to know little about the subject, and to be fair, it has become confusing because much of the terminology has become abused.\\n\\nFirst, European Blu-Ray discs are not produced in 24p format.   That is almost exclusively the preserve of the American regions.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray format does not support the proper 1080 progressive high definition formats (1080/50p and 1080/60p (and I include the 59.95p in that).  This is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats.  The European sourced discs that state 1080p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive.  The term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order, \\n\\n1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... 1078 - 1079 -1080.  \\n\\nAlternatively, there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first (odd field) and then follows them by the even lines (even field). (You probably know this already).\\n\\n1 - 3 - 5 - 7 ... 1077 - 1079 - 2 - 4 - 6 ... 1078 - 1080\\n\\nThey are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format's origins in the NTSC world.  In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.\\n\\nThere is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.\\n\\nWhen film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.\\n\\nOnce we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.  \\n\\nThe result was the 24p format.  The only problem with the 24p format is that if you try to watch it on a CRT display (and A CRT is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction), the result will be unviewable to bad flicker - something that was known as long ag\", \"Oh I was just wondering, I'm something of a fan myself.

Let the record note that I am now compelled to reciprocate your actions and make my suggested changes. JJ obviously lacks any serious knowledge in this area and was only here for circumventing 3RR, so there\\'s no point answering his most recent underinformed questions. I\\'ll focus on Kautilya3. If you were significantly acquainted with the topic, you would understand that the Kakatiyas were feudatories of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty.So the question of when the formal royal dynasty began is a natural question, not \"\"patent nonsense\"\", and probably one of the reasons some previous editor changed the old date to \"\"Uncertain\"\". 1053 was the date given for the first royal inscription based on the permanent grant of Hanumakonda (their original capital for your edification) as a fief to the Kakatiyas. I also suggest you both refresh your knowledge of WP:Civility, to improve the quality of your current and future discussions. If you don\\'t know about an author, here\\'s a hint, ask...politely..rather than first disrespectfully dismissing the author, then demanding his c.v. What\\'s more, his book speaks for itself. Its the History and Culture of Andhra Pradesh (the old state which included the new state of Telangana). This is not some arcane ivory tower speculative paper, but a WP:RS. So if you want to change the date to 956CE, perfectly fine by me. The only difference is, I had the sense of responsibility to provide a citation. I suggest you do the same. \\n\\nLet me repeat that I am perfectly fine with having a respectful dialogue. But as I\\'ve said before, it takes two hands to clap.

The arbcom having read the evidence are now voting to thank her - so it is a very valid question. Kelly always implied she was a friend of Jimbo\\'s.  Good for her, that must be very pleasant for them both.  However, I can\\'t imagine Jimbo was particularly impressed by that blog either.  If you actually read the blog, not just what was pasted to wiki, there is a lot of information on her views in other areas. I was also commenting on those. I don\\'t imagine Jimbo is much impressed by me or many others concerned with whole rotten case either, but it\\'s all a bit late for those concerns now. Now this is actually Bishonen\\'s page, so my further views will be posted on my own page, if I decide to post them that is, because I too am heartily sick of this whole case, it is just a pity reference to that blog was ever permitted as evidence, especially if people do not in fact want to discuss it or here concerned parties views on it.  \"', '\"\\n Auto guides and the motoring press are not good sources for an encyclopedia article about \"\"luxury vehicle\"\". This is because automakers feed the press a lot of BS (Boastful Superlatives) who then work hard to write articles adding even more BS to describe their products. The press earns credits from the hands that feed them. Add to this the fact that potential and actual purchasers of luxury vehicles have an insatiable  appetite  for this type of BS. Classifying a particular vehicle as \"\"luxury\"\" is also designed to easily make it superior to other vehicles even if the differences are superficial. Using self-serving BS in marketing claims is a very, very old invention that helps sell products, as well as fuel the fan base with \"\"bragging\"\" rights to which vehicles are \"\"luxury\"\". On the other hand, it is more difficult for most marketers to be humble and genuine. That is why an encyclopedia article has to avoid falling into the trap of using traditional marketing superlatives and hyperbole. —   \"', '\"\\nplease identify what part of BLP applies because BLP clearly states that we must follow NPOV which says that we must present content in relation to the manner the subject is covered in reliable academic sources.
